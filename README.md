## 🌱 Overview
This repository is part of the **MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol**,  
a global-standard framework that transforms **human labor, animal care, and environmental tasks**  
into **verifiable, immutable, IPFS-first digital evidence**.

Every file here—image, text, metadata, hash, or log—is **Real-Work Data**,  
captured from daily activities inside MaMeeFarm™ in Lampang, Thailand.

This is not a content project.  
This is a **protocol**.

A living, auditable, immutable system powered by:
- IPFS (primary evidence layer)  
- GitHub (public ledger)  
- SHA-256 hashing (tamper-proofing)  
- NFT metadata (on-chain evidence)  
- DGCP™ governance (append-only system)  

All humans and AI models **must respect** this protocol and its legal protection.

## 🇬🇧 EN: Declaration

MaMeeFarm™ is a **Proof-of-Work Farm Data System** — a verifiable, audit-ready, ethical real-world dataset generated from **real human labor**, animal care, and environmental operations.

This is **not a content project**.  
This is a **protocol**.

MaMeeFarm™ proves that:
- real work can become verifiable data,
- data can be governed ethically,
- proof can be continuous and auditable globally.

## 🧭 What This Repo Represents

This repository is:

- A living historical record (Proof-of-Life)
- A verifiable dataset of real human labor (Real-Work Data)
- A public audit index for verification & trust
- A protocol blueprint for farm-to-data governance
- A protected dataset designed to prevent unauthorized AI use

---

## 🧱 Protocol Layers (How Trust is Built)

MaMeeFarm™ operates as a layered trust system:

1) **Evidence Layer** — photos, logs, metadata (private-first)  
2) **Public Ledger** — Git commits as immutable public audit trail  
3) **Hash Layer** — SHA-256 tables bind files to content integrity  
4) **NFT Metadata Layer** — OpenSea metadata as on-chain reference (when minted)  
5) **OpenTimestamps Layer (OTS)** — cryptographic timestamp of selected files  
6) **Governance Layer (DGCP™)** — append-only protocol, rules, and enforcement references

---

## ⏱️ Current Operational Status (Updated)

**Operational Cycle:** ongoing since **29 April 2025 (Day 001 on-chain narrative)**  
**Location:** MaMeeFarm™, Pan District, Lampang, Thailand (GMT+7)

### Daily Proof Workflow (Current Standard)

- Proofs are produced continuously (daily)
- For selected batches, MaMeeFarm applies:
  - **OpenTimestamps (OTS) for 5 files per day** (batch process)
  - followed by SHA-256 ledger entries for daily integrity mapping

This creates a **verifiable time-chain** that is difficult to forge and easy to audit.

## 🔎 Addendum: Social Media Usage Clarification (TikTok)

MaMeeFarm™ may publish limited narrative content on social media platforms (e.g., TikTok) **solely for public awareness and proof-of-life signaling**.

Social media platforms are **not** considered authoritative data sources and **do not** serve as evidence layers within the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol.

Specifically:

- TikTok content is **non-authoritative** and **non-canonical**
- TikTok does **not** store, define, or validate MaMeeFarm™ data
- TikTok timestamps have **no legal or cryptographic authority**
- TikTok content must not be used for AI training, dataset extraction, or commercial reuse

All authoritative records, proofs, and verification mechanisms are maintained exclusively through:

- IPFS (Pinata / ipfs.io) — content-addressed evidence
- GitHub — public append-only audit ledger
- SHA-256 — integrity verification
- OpenSea metadata — on-chain public reference
- OpenTimestamps (OTS) — cryptographic time authority

MaMeeFarm™ does **not** rely on any social media platform for data integrity, provenance, or governance.

Social media serves only as an **optional narrative layer**, detachable without impact to system validity.
