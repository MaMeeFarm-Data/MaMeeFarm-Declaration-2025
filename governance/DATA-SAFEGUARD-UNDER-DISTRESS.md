# DATA-SAFEGUARD-UNDER-DISTRESS.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Data Safeguard Under Distress Protocol (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This protocol defines how Real-World Data (RWD) governed by DGCP must be protected
during periods of human, environmental, technical, or political distress.

DGCP assumes that truth is most vulnerable precisely when conditions are unstable.

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Distress does not invalidate reality.**

When humans or systems are under pressure, DGCP prioritizes:
- preservation over completeness
- safety over continuity
- truth over appearance

---

## 3. Types of Distress Covered

### 3.1 Human Distress
- illness or injury  
- emotional or psychological strain  
- burnout or exhaustion  
- personal or family crisis  

Human distress may reduce data output and is always valid.

---

### 3.2 Environmental Distress
- extreme weather  
- natural disasters  
- infrastructure damage  
- unsafe field conditions  

Safety overrides data collection.

---

### 3.3 Technical Distress
- power failure  
- device malfunction  
- data corruption  
- network instability  

Technical gaps must not be reconstructed.

---

### 3.4 Governance or Political Distress
- regulatory pressure  
- legal uncertainty  
- platform intervention  
- coercion or censorship attempts  

Truth preservation remains mandatory.

---

## 4. Safeguard Measures

### 4.1 Pause Without Penalty
Data generation may be paused without:
- penalty
- negative classification
- reconstruction requirement

A pause is itself a valid signal.

---

### 4.2 Minimal Preservation Mode
When distress occurs:
- preserve existing data
- secure originals
- avoid new processing
- delay non-essential publication

Minimal action reduces risk.

---

### 4.3 Emergency Anchoring
If possible during distress:
- anchor existing data (hash, IPFS, timestamp)
- document distress context
- defer analysis

Anchoring protects against future disputes.

---

## 5. Prohibited Actions During Distress
The following are strictly forbidden:
- forced continuity
- synthetic backfilling
- retrospective reconstruction
- aesthetic cleanup
- pressure-induced data generation

Distress must never justify fabrication.

---

## 6. Governance Responsibilities
During distress, governance must:
- prioritize human safety
- document context
- preserve append-only history
- resist external pressure
- delay non-critical decisions

Governance acts as a shield, not a driver.

---

## 7. AI Behavior Under Distress
AI systems must:
- respect pauses
- avoid filling gaps
- refrain from optimization
- support risk detection only

AI must not exploit vulnerability.

---

## 8. Audit Interpretation
Auditors must treat distress periods as:
- high-authenticity signals
- context-rich intervals
- non-comparable phases

Audits must not penalize reduced output.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This protocol aligns with:
- HUMAN-LIMITATION-GUIDELINES.md  
- CONSISTENCY-ACROSS-MULTI-DAY-WORKFLOW.md  
- DATA-ESCALATION-AND-RESOLUTION-PROTOCOL.md  
- RWD-ERROR-CORRECTION-BOUNDARIES.md  

Distress safeguards reinforce ethical governance.

---

## 10. Why This Protocol Matters
Most systems fail under stress.

DGCP is designed to **protect truth when pressure is highest**.

By safeguarding data under distress:
- coercion becomes visible
- fabrication is prevented
- human dignity is preserved
- long-term trust survives crises  

MaMeeFarm™ treats distress not as failure, but as **part of reality**.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This protocol applies to:
- disaster-prone regions  
- conflict or regulatory pressure zones  
- low-resource environments  
- humanitarian documentation  
- long-term public-interest archives  

DGCP establishes a global rule:  
**truth must be protected especially when it is hardest to keep**.
