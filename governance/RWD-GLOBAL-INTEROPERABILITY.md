# RWD-GLOBAL-INTEROPERABILITY.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Global Interoperability Framework for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines how Real-World Data (RWD) governed by DGCP can interoperate across platforms, institutions, jurisdictions, and technical systems without compromising provenance, human authenticity, or governance integrity.

Interoperability under DGCP means **shared verification**, not shared ownership.

---

## 2. Core Interoperability Principles

1. **Verification over Integration**  
   Systems interoperate by verifying truth, not by merging datasets.

2. **Provenance Preservation**  
   Original context, timestamps, and human-origin signals must remain intact.

3. **Platform Neutrality**  
   DGCP does not depend on any single platform, vendor, or protocol.

4. **Append-Only Compatibility**  
   Interoperable systems must respect append-only constraints.

5. **License Continuity**  
   MMFARM-POL-2025 travels with the data across all interfaces.

## 3. Interoperability Layers

### 3.1 Storage Layer
RWD may be stored on:
- decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS)  
- public repositories  
- institutional mirrors  

Storage replication does not imply data modification.

---

### 3.2 Metadata Layer
Interoperable metadata includes:
- content identifiers (CIDs)  
- timestamps  
- hashes  
- provenance references  

Metadata may be referenced but not rewritten.

---

### 3.3 Verification Layer
External systems may:
- verify timestamps  
- validate provenance chains  
- audit environmental and HLWP signals  

Verification tools must be non-invasive.

---

### 3.4 Governance Layer
Interoperability requires:
- respect for DGCP rules  
- compliance with Zero Synthetic Data Policy  
- acknowledgment of human-origin ownership  
- acceptance of public auditability  

Governance logic must not be overridden.

---

## 4. What Interoperability Is Not
DGCP interoperability does not allow:
- dataset aggregation  
- normalization across sources  
- synthetic harmonization  
- automated correction  
- cross-system reconstruction  

Interoperability must not erase differences.

---

## 5. Cross-System Interaction Scenarios

### 5.1 Research Collaboration
Institutions may reference RWD proofs without copying datasets.

### 5.2 AI Safety Evaluation
AI labs may audit RWD authenticity without training generative models on it.

### 5.3 Governmental Audit
Authorities may verify truth without claiming ownership.

### 5.4 Public Transparency
Citizens may inspect proofs without manipulation rights.

---

## 6. Conflict Handling
If an external system requires actions that violate DGCP rules:
- interoperability is denied  
- provenance integrity takes precedence  
- the refusal is documented publicly  

Compatibility never overrides truth.

---

## 7. Technical Compatibility Requirements
Interoperable systems must support:
- hash verification  
- timestamp comparison  
- append-only references  
- immutable identifiers  
- license notice propagation  

No proprietary lock-in is permitted.

---

## 8. Security Considerations
Interoperability must not:
- expose human identity beyond context  
- enable data scraping  
- allow derivative dataset creation  
- facilitate synthetic reproduction  

Security is enforced through transparency and traceability.

---

## 9. Why This Framework Matters
Most global systems aim for data unification.

DGCP aims for **truth compatibility**.

By enabling interoperability without homogenization:
- provenance remains intact  
- diversity of reality is preserved  
- audits remain meaningful  
- manipulation becomes detectable  

MaMeeFarm™ establishes a new global model:  
**systems can agree on truth without becoming the same**.

---

## 10. Global Applicability
This framework applies to:
- international research networks  
- AI governance ecosystems  
- supply-chain verification platforms  
- climate and agriculture monitoring  
- cross-border audit infrastructures  

DGCP enables interoperability without surrendering integrity.
