# MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ Governance Index

**Effective Date:** 18 December 2025  
**Status:** Active Governance Index  
**Scope:** All Governance Policies within the MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ Framework

---

## Purpose

This index provides a canonical map of all governance policies under MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof).

It exists to:
- Make governance discoverable and auditable
- Provide a stable reference for README / Whitepaper / Legal review
- Prevent governance fragmentation
- Support long-term maintenance as governance expands

Governance documents are living policies. Their effective dates reflect formal policy activation, while Git commits preserve the full revision history.

---

## Governance Authority Note

DGCP™ governance authority is anchored in:
- Public auditability (Git history)
- Cryptographic evidence layers (IPFS / SHA-256 / OTS)
- On-chain reference (when applicable)

Social media platforms are non-authoritative narrative layers and hold no governance authority.

---

## Governance Documents

### A) Platform & Narrative Boundary

1. **Non-Reliance on Social Media Platforms**  
   **File:** `DGCP-GOV-NonReliance-Social-Platforms.md`  
   **Effective Date:** 18 December 2025  
   **Summary:** Social media is non-authoritative; DGCP™ authority resides in IPFS, GitHub, SHA-256, on-chain metadata, and OTS.

---

### B) Time & Sequence Authority

2. **Time Authority Hierarchy**  
   **File:** `DGCP-GOV-Time-Authority-Hierarchy.md`  
   **Effective Date:** 18 December 2025  
   **Summary:** Defines tiered time authority. Cryptographic time (OTS) supersedes ledger/on-chain/narrative time.

---

### C) Proof Validity & System Integrity

3. **Proof Invalidation & Revocation**  
   **File:** `DGCP-GOV-Proof-Invalidation-Revocation.md`  
   **Effective Date:** 20 December 2025  
   **Summary:** Non-destructive invalidation via registry flags; preserves audit continuity while preventing reliance on compromised proofs.

---

### D) Data Ownership & Custody

4. **Data Custody & Ownership**  
   **File:** `DGCP-GOV-Data-Custody-Ownership.md`  
   **Effective Date:** 20 December 2025  
   **Summary:** Establishes ownership/custody separation; hosting never grants implied usage, training, or derivative rights.

---

### E) Governance Enforcement & Due Process

5. **Governance Enforcement Process**  
   **File:** `DGCP-GOV-Governance-Enforcement-Process.md`  
   **Effective Date:** 20 December 2025  
   **Summary:** Defines triggers, actions, and due process; emphasizes transparency, proportionality, and non-destructive enforcement.

---

## Maintenance Rules

- Material governance changes must be recorded via public commits.
- Each governance document must maintain:
  - Effective Date
  - Status
  - Defined scope
- Governance Index must be updated when:
  - A new governance policy is added
  - A policy is materially revised
  - A governance document is deprecated or replaced
