# RWD-GLOBAL-AUDIT-STANDARD. 
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Global Audit Standard for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document establishes the **Global Audit Standard** for reviewing, validating, and certifying Real-World Data (RWD) governed under DGCP.

The standard ensures that audits can be performed by independent parties worldwide without altering data, compromising human dignity, or violating provenance integrity.

---

## 2. Audit Philosophy
DGCP audits are based on one principle:

**Audit the truth without changing it.**

Audits verify continuity, authenticity, and compliance — not performance, productivity, or optimization.

---

## 3. Audit Scope
The Global Audit Standard applies to:
- RWD proofs and artifacts
- governance documents
- metadata and timestamps
- provenance chains
- access and license compliance
- escalation and resolution records

Audits cover systems, not individuals.

---

## 4. Auditor Requirements
Auditors must:
- be independent of data creation
- respect MMFARM-POL-2025
- agree to non-reconstruction rules
- accept human limitation as valid
- preserve public transparency

Auditors may not demand data alteration.

---

## 5. Audit Layers

### 5.1 Provenance Audit
- verify append-only history  
- validate hash and CID consistency  
- confirm no retroactive insertion  

---

### 5.2 Timestamp Audit
- check EXIF → IPFS → Git → Blockchain order  
- identify gaps or reversals  
- correlate with environmental signals  

---

### 5.3 Human-Origin Audit
- review HLWP continuity  
- assess fatigue and pacing plausibility  
- validate human-context consistency  

---

### 5.4 Environmental Entropy Audit
- confirm natural variability  
- detect staged repetition  
- validate seasonal and weather alignment  

---

### 5.5 Governance Compliance Audit
- confirm protocol adherence  
- verify license attachment  
- review escalation handling  
- assess access control enforcement  

---

## 6. Audit Outcomes
Audit results must be classified as:
- **Verified** — meets DGCP standards  
- **Uncertain** — ambiguity preserved, not corrected  
- **Invalid** — provenance or governance breach identified  

Outcomes must be publicly recorded.

---

## 7. Prohibited Audit Actions
Auditors must not:
- request reconstructed data  
- demand corrected or “cleaned” files  
- infer missing events  
- impose productivity benchmarks  
- privatize audit findings  

Audit authority does not override truth.

---

## 8. Audit Transparency
All audits must:
- publish methodology  
- disclose limitations  
- timestamp findings  
- link to reviewed records  

Secrecy undermines trust.

---

## 9. Conflict Handling
If auditors disagree:
- multiple conclusions may coexist  
- dissent is documented  
- data remains unchanged  

DGCP accepts plural interpretation over forced consensus.

---

## 10. Why This Standard Matters
Traditional audits assume clean, optimized data.

DGCP audits reality.

By standardizing truth-preserving audits:
- manipulation becomes visible  
- synthetic blending is exposed  
- human labor remains respected  
- global trust becomes possible  

MaMeeFarm™ defines auditing as **witnessing reality**, not correcting it.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This standard applies to:
- international research audits  
- AI safety evaluations  
- supply-chain verification  
- climate and agriculture reviews  
- public-interest data governance  

DGCP provides the world with its first **human-first audit standard for real-world data**.
