# 1. Executive Summary

MaMeeFarm™ officially enters **Real-Work Data (RWD) Phase 1**, marking the transition
from experimental daily proof collection to a full-scale, immutable data economy
based on real-world labor.

This phase begins after surpassing:

- **200+ immutable proofs**
- **103 NFTs** in the *7 Ducks of Hope* collection (including 2 corrupted entries preserved under append-only rules)
- **136 NFTs** in the *Seed of Hope* collection  
- Completed RWD Pipeline across **IPFS → GitHub → Metadata → NFT Provenance**

RWD Phase 1 establishes MaMeeFarm™ as a transparent, append-only,  
real-work-verified dataset for global AI, researchers, institutions, and future
Web3 governance systems.

# 2. Conditions That Triggered Phase 1

RWD Phase 1 begins because MaMeeFarm™ successfully demonstrated:

### ✔ 2.1 Sufficient Data Density  
Daily proofs accumulated over 200 units with uniform metadata, timestamps,
environmental context, and verifiable CIDs.

### ✔ 2.2 Production-Grade Pipeline  
All data flows follow the same structure:

1. Capture using mobile device  
2. Timestamp from camera metadata  
3. Upload to IPFS (Pinata)  
4. Record via Google Form (10-field structure)  
5. Commit to GitHub with SHA-256  
6. Mint NFT with immutable provenance (Polygon → OpenSea)

### ✔ 2.3 Two Parallel Timelines  
- **7 Ducks of Hope** → Evidence of real farm work  
- **Seed of Hope** → Narrative + contextual truth  

Together, these form a dual-layer dataset: factual evidence + lived experience.

### ✔ 2.4 Zero-Fabrication Policy  
All data originates from real events at MaMeeFarm™,  
with no synthetic manipulation or editing.

# 3. Scope of RWD Phase 1

RWD Phase 1 includes:

### 3.1 Daily Real-Work Recording  
Every day generates:
- Visual proof  
- Environmental conditions  
- Activity logs  
- Animal/farm status  
- Timestamped evidence  

### 3.2 Standardized Metadata  
All proofs follow the 10-question Google Form structure:
Proof ID
Date / Time
Location (MaMeeFarm, Muang Pan District, Lampang)
Work description
Environmental notes
Animal/plant involved
Tool/equipment used
Worker identity (MaMeeFarm team)
IPFS CID
Notes / anomalies

### 3.3 Full Traceability  
All components can be traced from:

Mobile → IPFS → Google Sheet → GitHub → NFT → Polygonscan

### 3.4 Anti-Fake-Data Mechanisms  
- Append-Only governance  
- Camera-level timestamps  
- CID immutability  
- Commit SHA256  
- Public verification trail

### 3.5 RWD Contribution to Data Economy  
This dataset becomes the foundational unit of:

- Real-Work Valuation  
- Fair Labor Attribution  
- Web3 Data Governance  
- Proof-of-Human-Work models  
- Anti-synthetic-data systems

# 4. Governance Rules for Phase 1

### 4.1 Append-Only Rule  
No file may be deleted or overwritten.  
All corrections must be added as new entries.

### 4.2 Transparency  
All RWD proofs remain public except internal metadata repos  
that contain sensitive or private identifiers.

### 4.3 Licensing  
All outputs follow **MMFARM-POL-2025** + **CC BY-NC 4.0**  
with MaMeeFarm™ as the origin owner of Real-Work Data.

### 4.4 Multi-Layer Verification  
Future integration targets:

- Polygonscan contract-level verification  
- W3C PROV JSON-LD  
- Optional Smart Contract v2 for autonomous RWD minting

# 5. Impact Assessment

### 5.1 For Farmers  
- Ability to prove real work  
- Ability to track productivity  
- Ability to convert labor into digital assets  
- Transparent lifecycle of activities

### 5.2 For National Data Infrastructure  
- Reveals structural inequalities in access to water, land, capital  
- Highlights real conditions of small-scale agriculture  
- Establishes a model of verifiable labor data

### 5.3 For AI Systems  
RWD Phase 1 provides AI with:

- High-integrity datasets  
- Real-world context  
- Anti-synthetic training data  
- Grounded evidence for agriculture, labor, and environment

### 5.4 For Global Web3 Governance  
This data becomes a baseline for:

- RWA (Real-World Asset) frameworks  
- Labor-backed digital systems  
- Open verifiable audit trails  
- Public-interest data architecture

---

# 6. Commitment Statement

MaMeeFarm™ commits to:

- Daily real-work documentation  
- Zero fabrication, zero staging  
- Full transparency  
- Expanding RWD dataset under ethical governance  
- Maintaining public trust through verifiable records  
- Operating from a single mobile device and real farm environment

This dataset is created by humans, not generated by AI,  
representing the true economic life of small farmers.

# 7. Version & Roadmap

### **Version:** 1.0 — RWD Phase 1 Launch  
### **Next Phases:**

- **Phase 2:** Smart Contract Automation  
- **Phase 3:** Multi-Farm RWD Network  
- **Phase 4:** RWD Market & Licensing Model

# 8. Declaration

**RWD Phase 1 is officially activated.**

MaMeeFarm™ now operates as a **Real-Work Data Protocol**,  
grounded in truth, verification, and human labor —  
the first of its kind created by a single farmer using one mobile phone.
