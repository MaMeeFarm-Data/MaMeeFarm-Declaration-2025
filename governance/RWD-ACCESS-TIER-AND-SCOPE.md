# RWD-ACCESS-TIER-AND-SCOPE.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Access Tier & Scope Model for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **Access Tier & Scope Model** for Real-World Data (RWD)
governed under DGCP.

The model ensures that access is:
- explicit
- proportional
- revocable
- non-derivative
- aligned with truth preservation

Access control applies to **use**, not to **existence**.

---

## 2. Core Access Principle
**No access is implicit. All access is scoped.**

DGCP rejects default openness that enables extraction or misuse.
Every access grant must declare *who*, *why*, *how*, and *for how long*.

---

## 3. Access Dimensions
Access is defined across four dimensions:
1. **Actor** — who may access
2. **Purpose** — why access is granted
3. **Method** — how data may be used
4. **Duration** — how long access remains valid

All four must be explicitly declared.

---

## 4. Access Tiers

### Tier 0 — Public Verification
- read-only viewing
- provenance inspection
- hash/CID verification
- audit trail review

No bulk access. No automated extraction.

---

### Tier 1 — Research & Audit Access
- structured review
- cross-record comparison
- governance evaluation

Prohibited:
- data normalization
- derivative dataset creation
- AI training

---

### Tier 2 — Governance & Compliance Access
- decision review
- escalation handling
- compliance verification
- license enforcement

Access is logged and attributable.

---

### Tier 3 — Restricted Operational Access
- limited operational interaction
- explicit scope and duration
- heightened monitoring

Granted only by governance decision.

---

### Tier 4 — Emergency Preservation Access
- preservation-only actions
- anchoring and securing data
- no analysis or reuse

Activated only during distress or failure.

---

## 5. Scope Constraints
Regardless of tier, access may never include:
- generative use
- behavioral imitation
- reconstruction
- abstraction for resale
- pattern extraction

Scope limits override tier privileges.

---

## 6. Access Grant Process
All access requires:
1. documented request
2. purpose declaration
3. scope definition
4. governance approval
5. public record

Undocumented access is invalid.

---

## 7. Access Revocation
Access may be revoked if:
- scope is exceeded
- license is violated
- misuse is detected
- governance requires restriction

Revocation affects access, not data.

---

## 8. AI-Specific Access Rules
AI systems:
- may only receive Tier 0 or Tier 1 access
- must operate in read-only mode
- may not store derived representations
- may not train or simulate

AI access is always provisional.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This model operates with:
- DATA-REVOCATION-POLICY.md  
- RWD-IP-AND-LICENSE-BOUNDARY.md  
- GOVERNANCE-DECISION-FLOW.md  
- PERMISSION-AND-ACCESS-CONTROL.md  

Access tiers operationalize governance boundaries.

---

## 10. Why This Model Matters
Most systems collapse access control into permission flags.

DGCP treats access as **ethical infrastructure**.

By enforcing tiered and scoped access:
- misuse is constrained
- accountability is preserved
- trust remains durable
- human-origin data is protected

MaMeeFarm™ defines access as **temporary trust**, not entitlement.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This model applies to:
- international audits
- AI safety collaborations
- cross-border research
- public-interest transparency systems

DGCP establishes a universal rule:  
**access must never exceed purpose**.
