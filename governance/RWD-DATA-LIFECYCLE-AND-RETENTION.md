# RWD-DATA-LIFECYCLE-AND-RETENTION.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Data Lifecycle & Retention Standard for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **Data Lifecycle and Retention Standard** for
Real-World Data (RWD) governed under DGCP.

The standard ensures that RWD remains traceable, auditable, and truthful
from the moment of creation through long-term preservation.

---

## 2. Core Lifecycle Principle
**Real-world data has no expiration date.**

DGCP treats RWD as a historical truth record.
Time may change interpretation, but never legitimacy.

---

## 3. Lifecycle Stages

### 3.1 Creation
- data is captured in real conditions
- timestamps and raw metadata are preserved
- no pre-processing is allowed

Creation is the only moment data enters the system.

---

### 3.2 Anchoring
- cryptographic hashes are generated
- IPFS CIDs or equivalent identifiers are assigned
- anchoring timestamps are recorded

Anchoring locks data into verifiable history.

---

### 3.3 Publication
- data is made visible according to access tier
- governance records are linked
- license is embedded

Publication does not change the data.

---

### 3.4 Active Reference
- data may be referenced for audit, verification, or research
- annotations may be added as separate records
- interpretations may evolve

Reference is additive, not transformative.

---

### 3.5 Long-Term Preservation
- data remains accessible in append-only archives
- multiple mirrors are encouraged
- platform migration is documented

Preservation prioritizes durability over convenience.

---

## 4. Retention Policy
Under DGCP:
- no scheduled deletion is permitted
- retention is indefinite
- loss is documented, not concealed
- partial degradation is recorded

Deletion is considered a governance failure.

---

## 5. Controlled Visibility Over Time
Visibility may change while data remains intact:
- access may be reduced or revoked
- public references may be limited
- sensitive context may be restricted

Existence is immutable; visibility is governed.

---

## 6. Migration & Format Evolution
When formats or platforms change:
- original files remain authoritative
- migrated copies are explicitly labeled
- provenance links original to migrated versions

Migration must never replace originals.

---

## 7. AI Interaction Over the Lifecycle
AI systems may:
- assist lifecycle tracking
- support archival audits
- flag degradation risks

AI systems may not:
- summarize lifecycle content for training
- compress or abstract historical records
- generate replacement artifacts

AI respects temporal integrity.

---

## 8. End-of-System Scenarios
If DGCP systems are discontinued:
- existing records remain authoritative
- last valid state is preserved
- governance history remains public

Truth outlives systems.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This standard operates with:
- RWD-CHANGE-PREVENTION-MECHANISM.md  
- DATA-REVOCATION-POLICY.md  
- DGCP-RESILIENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md  
- RWD-GLOBAL-AUDIT-STANDARD.md  

Lifecycle governance ensures continuity across decades.

---

## 10. Why This Standard Matters
Most data systems treat data as disposable.

DGCP treats data as **historical evidence**.

By defining strict lifecycle and retention rules:
- manipulation becomes visible
- audits remain possible decades later
- human labor is preserved
- truth remains intact across generations

MaMeeFarm™ establishes data retention as **ethical responsibility**.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This standard applies to:
- agricultural and environmental records
- humanitarian documentation
- AI safety benchmarks
- public-interest data archives
- long-term governance systems

DGCP establishes a universal rule:  
**truth must be preserved longer than institutions last**.
