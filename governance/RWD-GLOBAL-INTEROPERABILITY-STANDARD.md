# RWD-GLOBAL-INTEROPERABILITY-STANDARD.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Global Interoperability Standard for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **Global Interoperability Standard** for Real-World Data (RWD) governed under DGCP.

Its purpose is to ensure that RWD produced within MaMeeFarm™ and DGCP systems
can be verified, interpreted, and audited across:
- countries
- institutions
- platforms
- AI systems
- future data infrastructures

without loss of truth, provenance, or human context.

---

## 2. Core Interoperability Principle
**Interoperability must not simplify reality.**

DGCP interoperability prioritizes:
- semantic integrity over format convenience  
- provenance continuity over system compatibility  
- human context over machine optimization  

Data must travel **without being flattened**.

---

## 3. Scope of Interoperability
This standard governs interoperability across:
- storage systems  
- audit frameworks  
- governance regimes  
- legal jurisdictions  
- AI analysis environments  

Interoperability applies to interpretation, not alteration.

---

## 4. Interoperability Layers

### 4.1 Structural Interoperability
RWD must be transferable with:
- original files intact  
- append-only history preserved  
- clear file naming and hierarchy  
- stable identifiers  

No structural compression is allowed.

---

### 4.2 Provenance Interoperability
Systems must be able to:
- trace timestamps across layers  
- verify hashes and CIDs  
- reconstruct audit trails  
- identify gaps without filling them  

Provenance must remain readable everywhere.

---

### 4.3 Semantic Interoperability
RWD must retain:
- original meaning  
- human explanations  
- contextual annotations  
- uncertainty markers  

Semantic loss is treated as data degradation.

---

### 4.4 Governance Interoperability
External systems must respect:
- DGCP governance decisions  
- escalation records  
- audit outcomes  
- license boundaries  

No external authority may override governance history.

---

### 4.5 AI Interoperability
AI systems may:
- read RWD for analysis  
- flag anomalies  
- assist auditing  

AI systems may not:
- normalize or optimize data  
- generate replacements  
- simulate missing context  
- infer undocumented actions  

AI interoperability is strictly read-only.

---

## 5. Prohibited Interoperability Practices
The following are not permitted:
- format conversion that removes metadata  
- re-labeling for convenience  
- schema enforcement that removes ambiguity  
- AI-driven abstraction layers  
- silent translation of meaning  

Compatibility must never erase reality.

---

## 6. Cross-Jurisdiction Considerations
When RWD crosses borders:
- original governance rules apply  
- local compliance is additive  
- conflicts are documented publicly  

Jurisdiction does not rewrite truth.

---

## 7. Interoperability Failure Handling
If interoperability fails:
- failure is documented  
- original data remains authoritative  
- no reconstruction is attempted  

Incompatibility is safer than distortion.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This standard operates with:
- PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL.md  
- RWD-GLOBAL-AUDIT-STANDARD.md  
- DATA-REFERENCE-POLICY.md  
- DGCP-RESILIENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md  

Interoperability binds DGCP to the outside world.

---

## 9. Why This Standard Matters
Most systems demand that data adapt to them.

DGCP demands that systems adapt to reality.

By enforcing strict interoperability rules:
- trust survives translation  
- audits remain valid globally  
- AI misuse is constrained  
- human-origin data remains intact  

MaMeeFarm™ defines interoperability as **respect for truth across systems**.

---

## 10. Global Applicability
This standard applies to:
- international research networks  
- AI safety collaborations  
- government data exchanges  
- supply-chain verification  
- long-term truth archives  

DGCP offers the world a way to share data **without sacrificing reality**.
