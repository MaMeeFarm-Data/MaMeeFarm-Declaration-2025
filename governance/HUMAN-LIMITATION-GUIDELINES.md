# HUMAN-LIMITATION-GUIDELINES.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Human Limitation Guidelines (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document establishes formal guidelines for recognizing, preserving, and respecting **human limitations** within the DGCP Real-World Data (RWD) system.

DGCP treats human limitation not as an error, but as a **core truth signal** essential to provenance, ethics, and auditability.

---

## 2. Foundational Principle
Real-World Data is created by real humans under real constraints.

Therefore:
- inconsistency is expected  
- fatigue is normal  
- interruptions are valid  
- mistakes are informative  
- absence of data is meaningful  

Any system that rejects human limitation rejects reality itself.

---

## 3. Types of Human Limitations

### 3.1 Physical Limitations
- fatigue from manual labor  
- illness or injury  
- heat, cold, or dehydration  
- limited mobility or strength  

Physical strain affects timing, quality, and volume of data — and must be preserved.

---

### 3.2 Cognitive Limitations
- reduced concentration  
- memory lapses  
- decision fatigue  
- stress-induced errors  

These are legitimate components of HLWP and must not be “corrected.”

---

### 3.3 Emotional Limitations
- anxiety  
- grief  
- frustration  
- uncertainty  
- exhaustion  

Emotional state influences human behavior and data patterns and must be acknowledged as context.

---

### 3.4 Resource Limitations
- limited power supply  
- unstable network  
- device malfunction  
- lack of tools or materials  

RWD must reflect actual resource scarcity, not ideal conditions.

---

## 4. Governance Rules Regarding Limitations

### 4.1 Missing Data Policy
- Missing data is allowed  
- Missing data must not be reconstructed  
- Missing data must not be inferred  
- Gaps may be documented but not filled  

Absence itself is part of the data.

---

### 4.2 Imperfect Data Policy
- Blurred images are acceptable  
- Incomplete logs are acceptable  
- Typos and grammar errors are acceptable  
- Irregular timing is acceptable  

Perfection is a synthetic signal.

---

### 4.3 Non-Punitive Principle
No penalty may be applied for:
- missed days  
- incomplete proofs  
- irregular activity  
- reduced productivity  

DGCP rejects productivity metrics as governance criteria.

---

## 5. Interaction with AI Systems
AI systems must:
- accept human limitation as valid  
- refrain from labeling gaps as “errors”  
- never auto-complete missing RWD  
- never normalize or optimize human behavior  

AI may analyze limitations but must not erase them.

---

## 6. Audit Interpretation Guidelines
During audits:
- gaps require context, not correction  
- fatigue patterns support authenticity  
- inconsistency supports human origin  
- irregularity strengthens trust  

Auditors must never demand synthetic completeness.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
These guidelines operate alongside:
- HUMAN-LEVEL-WORK-PATTERN.md  
- ZERO-SYNTHETIC-DATA-POLICY.md  
- RWD-DATA-CLEANLINESS-STANDARD.md  
- PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL.md  

Human limitation is a governance pillar, not an exception.

---

## 8. Why This Matters
Most modern data systems erase humans.

DGCP preserves them.

By protecting human limitation:
- provenance becomes believable  
- synthetic data becomes detectable  
- ethics remain intact  
- trust becomes durable  

MaMeeFarm™ recognizes that **human limitation is proof of life**.

---

## 9. Global Relevance
These guidelines are applicable to:
- agricultural labor records  
- climate field data  
- humanitarian documentation  
- low-resource research environments  
- AI safety evaluation  
- human-centric governance models  

DGCP sets a precedent:  
**data must serve humans, not replace them**.
