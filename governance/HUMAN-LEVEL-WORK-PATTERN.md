# HUMAN-LEVEL-WORK-PATTERN.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Human Work Pattern Framework (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the structure of **Human-Level Work Patterns (HLWP)**   
the real-world biological, cognitive, emotional, and environmental sequences  
that form the foundation of MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data (RWD).

HLWP describes patterns that **cannot be synthetically reproduced**  
by AI models, automated systems, or fake data factories.

---

## 2. Definition
A **Human-Level Work Pattern** is a verifiable sequence of actions created by a real human under real constraints:

- limited resources  
- physical fatigue  
- inconsistent tools  
- real environment  
- emotional states  
- time pressure  
- imperfect decisions  
- biological rhythms  

These characteristics generate **unique data signatures** that cannot be faked or repeated by machines.

## 3. Components of HLWP

### 3.1 Physical Layer (Proof-of-Work)
Daily real-world actions performed at MaMeeFarm:
- collecting eggs from surviving ducks  
- cutting banana leaves  
- manual irrigation and water pumping  
- walking 3 km to buy food  
- repairing farm tools with no budget  
- managing farm animals with limited resources  

These tasks introduce biological randomness, environmental variation, and fatigue-driven decision patterns.

---

### 3.2 Cognitive Layer (Proof-of-Mind)
High-complexity intellectual work performed by P’Toh:
- designing DGCP governance  
- writing declarations, ethics, and evaluation guidelines  
- maintaining commit chains  
- auditing timestamps (EXIF → IPFS → Git → NFT)  
- correcting blind spots in AI and RWD systems  

This produces a mixed dataset of “manual labor + system architecture”  
that is globally rare and extremely high-integrity.

---

### 3.3 Emotional Layer (Proof-of-Heart)
HLWP always includes the emotional conditions of a real farmer:
- uncertainty  
- frustration  
- determination  
- hope  
- exhaustion  
- adaptation to hardship  

These states shape the timing, decision patterns, and work intensity   
none of which can be replicated by synthetic systems.

---

### 3.4 Environmental Layer
Environmental constraints at MaMeeFarm:
- only solar electricity  
- unstable network  
- limited water access  
- no refrigerator  
- rural isolation  
- real wildlife and farm risks  

These conditions shape the structure of the data and add  
**non-synthetic environmental signatures**.

---

## 4. Why HLWP Matters
HLWP is the backbone of MaMeeFarm™ RWD because:

- It proves the dataset comes from a human living inside real constraints  
- It creates *non-repeatable data* that AI cannot fabricate  
- It establishes data provenance through daily multi-layer timestamps  
- It becomes a reliable “truth anchor” in a fake-data majority era  
- It makes DGCP globally relevant for AI safety and verification research  

---

## 5. Governance Requirement
All HLWP entries must comply with:
- **MMFARM-POL-2025** (Proof-of-Life License)  
- **DGCP Integrity Protocol**  
- **Append-only chain structure**  
- **Multi-layer timestamping**  
  - EXIF  
  - IPFS CID  
  - Git commit hash  
  - OpenSea / NFT metadata  

HLWP must remain **unaltered, undeleted, append-only**.
