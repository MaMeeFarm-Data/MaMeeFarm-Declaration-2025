# PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Provenance Consistency Model (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **Provenance Consistency Model** used to verify that Real-World Data (RWD) maintains logical, temporal, environmental, and human-origin consistency across time.

The objective is to ensure that every data point belongs to a **continuous, believable, and non-synthetic reality chain**.

---

## 2. Definition of Provenance Consistency
Provenance consistency means that RWD must remain coherent across:

- Time (chronology)
- Human behavior (HLWP)
- Environment (entropy & conditions)
- Tools and devices (capability limits)
- Governance rules (append-only, no reconstruction)

Any contradiction signals potential manipulation or synthetic contamination.

---

## 3. Consistency Dimensions

### 3.1 Temporal Consistency
RWD must follow strict chronological order:
- No time reversal
- No impossible overlaps
- No retroactive insertion

**Rule:**  
EXIF ≤ IPFS ≤ Git ≤ Blockchain (if used)

---

### 3.2 Human-Level Work Pattern (HLWP) Consistency
Human behavior must remain plausible over time:
- Fatigue accumulation
- Task pacing
- Breaks and interruptions
- Variability across days

Perfect regularity is a red flag.

---

### 3.3 Environmental Consistency
Environmental signals must align with recorded time:
- Weather
- Temperature / humidity
- Lighting and shadows
- Seasonal indicators
- Animal behavior

Mismatch indicates staging or synthesis.

---

### 3.4 Tool & Resource Consistency
RWD must respect real-world constraints:
- Device capability limits
- Power availability
- Network instability
- Rural infrastructure constraints

Data that exceeds tool limits is invalid.

---

### 3.5 Governance Consistency
All data must comply with:
- Append-only rules
- Zero Synthetic Data Policy
- MMFARM-POL-2025 License
- DGCP Governance Framework

Governance violations invalidate provenance.

---

## 4. Inconsistency Detection Signals

### High-Risk Indicators
- Reconstructed missing days
- Identical patterns across long periods
- Impossible productivity levels
- Perfect environmental repetition
- Timestamp compression

### Medium-Risk Indicators
- Minor timestamp drift without explanation
- Sudden behavioral changes without context
- Unusual data density spikes

All indicators trigger review, not automatic deletion.

---

## 5. Review & Resolution Process

1. Flag inconsistency
2. Preserve original data (no deletion)
3. Add contextual explanation if available
4. Mark status: *verified*, *uncertain*, or *invalid*
5. Publish review outcome in governance logs

Absence of data is allowed; reconstruction is not.

---

## 6. Why Provenance Consistency Matters
Without consistency:
- RWD becomes unverifiable
- Synthetic data can blend in
- Trust collapses
- Governance loses authority

With consistency:
- Truth becomes auditable
- Human reality remains protected
- AI misuse is prevented
- Global validation becomes possible

---

## 7. Global Applicability
This model enables:
- Cross-border audits
- AI safety validation
- Scientific reproducibility
- Long-term trust anchoring
- Public transparency without central authority

MaMeeFarm™ establishes provenance as a **living continuity**, not a static snapshot.
