# DGCP Governance: Data Custody & Ownership

**Effective Date:** 20 December 2025  
**Status:** Active Governance Policy  
**Applies to:** All MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ Data, Proofs, and Derivatives

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes clear boundaries between data ownership, custody, and access within the DGCP™ framework.

---

## 2. Ownership Principle

All data generated through MaMeeFarm™ operations remains the exclusive intellectual property of MaMeeFarm™ unless explicitly licensed otherwise in writing.

Ownership is independent of:
- Hosting location
- Platform infrastructure
- Access method

---

## 3. Custody Definition

Custody refers solely to data hosting or transmission capability.

Custody does **not** imply:
- Ownership
- Usage rights
- Training rights
- Derivative rights

---

## 4. Platform Neutrality

Third-party platforms may provide infrastructure services but acquire no implicit rights over DGCP™ data.

Any claim of implied ownership or usage constitutes a governance violation.

---

## 5. Enforcement

Unauthorized custody or ownership claims trigger:
- Governance enforcement actions
- License revocation
- Public registry clarification if required
