# DGCP Governance: Operational Playbook

**Effective Date:** 30 December 2025  
**Status:** Active Governance Playbook  
**Scope:** Day-to-Day DGCP™ Operations

---

## Purpose

This playbook translates governance policies into operational guidance.

---

## Core Operational Practices

- All proofs must follow validation pipelines
- All governance actions require documentation
- Non-authoritative platforms remain narrative-only
- Enforcement actions are non-destructive and auditable
- Privacy and safety checks precede disclosure

---

## Operational Authority

Operations must align with:
- Governance Index
- Changelog
- Active policy documents

Conflicts defer to cryptographic evidence and governance hierarchy.
