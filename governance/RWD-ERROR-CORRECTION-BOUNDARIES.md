# RWD-ERROR-CORRECTION-BOUNDARIES.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Error Correction Boundaries for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines strict boundaries for how “errors” in Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP may be handled.

DGCP distinguishes between:
- **error correction** (which alters reality) and
- **error contextualization** (which preserves reality).

Only contextualization is permitted.

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Reality is never corrected. It is only explained.**

Any action that rewrites, replaces, smooths, or reconstructs original data
constitutes a violation of DGCP provenance integrity.

---

## 3. What Counts as an “Error”
Under DGCP, the following are NOT errors:
- blurred images due to motion
- missing entries due to human limitation
- irregular timing
- typos or incomplete notes
- environmental interference
- device limitations

These are signals of real-world conditions.

---

## 4. Prohibited Error “Corrections”
The following actions are strictly forbidden:

1. Editing original images or files  
2. Replacing low-quality data with clearer versions  
3. Reconstructing missing days or events  
4. Normalizing timestamps or sequences  
5. Rewriting human notes for consistency  
6. Inferring undocumented actions  
7. Using AI to “fix” imperfect data  

Any of the above invalidates provenance.

---

## 5. Permitted Error Contextualization
The following actions are allowed:

- adding explanatory notes as new records  
- flagging uncertainty without altering data  
- annotating device or environmental limitations  
- documenting human fatigue or interruption  
- marking status as *uncertain* or *incomplete*  

Context must never overwrite source data.

---

## 6. Boundary Rules

1. Original data is immutable  
2. Corrections must be additive, never substitutive  
3. Context must be timestamped and attributable  
4. Multiple interpretations may coexist  
5. Historical ambiguity must remain visible  

DGCP favors transparency over resolution.

---

## 7. AI-Specific Restrictions
AI systems may:
- flag anomalies
- suggest review
- assist in documentation

AI systems may not:
- auto-correct data
- reconstruct missing content
- smooth inconsistencies
- generate replacement proofs

AI assistance must never cross correction boundaries.

---

## 8. Audit Interpretation
During audits:
- imperfections increase authenticity
- gaps require explanation, not repair
- ambiguity is preserved, not eliminated
- correction attempts are treated as risk signals

Auditors must not demand “clean” perfection.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This boundary framework operates with:
- RWD-DATA-CLEANLINESS-STANDARD.md  
- PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL.md  
- HUMAN-LIMITATION-GUIDELINES.md  
- DATA-ESCALATION-AND-RESOLUTION-PROTOCOL.md  

Error boundaries protect the truth chain.

---

## 10. Why This Matters
Most data systems hide reality behind correction.

DGCP exposes reality by refusing to correct it.

By enforcing strict boundaries:
- manipulation becomes detectable
- synthetic blending is prevented
- human labor remains visible
- trust remains durable

MaMeeFarm™ establishes **error boundaries as a governance feature**, not a flaw.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
These boundaries apply to:
- field research data
- agricultural records
- climate observations
- humanitarian documentation
- AI safety datasets
- public-interest provenance systems

DGCP sets a global precedent:  
**truth is preserved, not perfected**.
