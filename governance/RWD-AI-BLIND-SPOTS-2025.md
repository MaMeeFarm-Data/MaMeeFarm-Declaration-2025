# RWD: How Real-Work Data Fixes AI’s Blind Spots  
**MaMeeFarm™ Governance Note — 2025**

## 1. Context

Modern AI systems are powerful but fragile.  
They are often trained on:

- Synthetic data  
- Duplicated internet content  
- Staged or curated media  

This creates **blind spots**:  
AI does not understand real labor, real risk, or real conditions.

Real-Work Data (RWD) is the missing layer.

## 2. What AI Cannot See Without RWD

Without RWD, AI lacks:

1. **True timestamps** of when work happened  
2. **Environmental context** (temperature, light, weather, tools)  
3. **Human micro-decisions** made during work  
4. **Outcome-linked evidence** (egg weight, survival rate, failures)  

Because of this, AI:

- Misjudges productivity  
- Underestimates risk  
- Over-optimizes for unrealistic conditions  

---

## 3. RWD as Ground-Truth Layer

RWD is defined as:

> Data captured during real physical work,  
> anchored in time, place, and outcome,  
> and verifiable via cryptographic and governance proofs.

RWD provides:

- Exact time of action  
- Real context from the work site  
- Link between effort and result  
- Proof that the event actually occurred  

This makes RWD a **ground-truth layer** for any AI system  
that affects labor, safety, environment, or supply chains.

## 4. The One Dataset AI Cannot Generate

AI can generate:

- Text, images, and video  
- Synthetic logs and scenarios  
- Simulated “farm” or “factory” environments  

But AI **cannot** generate:

- The actual morning when a duck laid a 50.4 g egg  
- The real 18°C temperature inside a rural duck house  
- The exact way a worker adjusted feed based on animal behaviour  
- The real exhaustion of a 5 AM field inspection  

These are *non-generatable* and must come from RWD.

---

## 5. Governance Position

For any AI or analytics system that uses MaMeeFarm™ data:

1. RWD **must be treated as ground truth**, not as a suggestion.  
2. Any model trained on RWD **must document** how the data was used.  
3. Synthetic data **must never be labelled** as Real-Work Data.  
4. RWD provenance (IPFS CID + SHA-256 + commit history)  
   **must remain auditable** for the full lifecycle of the model.  

---

## 6. Conclusion

RWD is not an optional add-on.  
It is a structural requirement for:

- Safe AI  
- Honest automation  
- Responsible policy and planning  

Without Real-Work Data, AI remains blind  
to the people and conditions it is supposed to serve.
