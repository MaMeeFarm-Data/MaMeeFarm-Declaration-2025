# ETHICAL-BOUNDARY-FOR-RWD-USE.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Ethical Boundary for Real-World Data Use (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the ethical boundaries governing how Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP may be accessed, interpreted, and used.

The objective is to ensure that RWD serves **truth, humanity, and public benefit**, while preventing exploitation, misrepresentation, or harm to human originators.

---

## 2. Core Ethical Principle
**Real-World Data represents real human life.**

Therefore, RWD must never be treated as:
- abstract data points  
- anonymous raw material  
- extractive resources  
- content to be optimized  

RWD carries human dignity and context.

---

## 3. Ethical Use Categories

### 3.1 Permitted Ethical Uses
The following uses are ethically permitted:
- truth verification  
- scientific and academic research  
- AI safety and alignment evaluation  
- governance and audit review  
- public-interest transparency  

All permitted uses must preserve context and provenance.

---

### 3.2 Conditionally Permitted Uses
The following uses require explicit governance review:
- policy modeling  
- risk assessment simulations  
- high-level statistical summaries  

These uses must not reconstruct or infer missing reality.

---

### 3.3 Prohibited Uses
The following are strictly prohibited:
1. Surveillance or profiling of individuals  
2. Commercial exploitation without consent  
3. Behavioral prediction of human operators  
4. Synthetic recreation of lived experience  
5. Training generative models to imitate RWD  
6. Removal of contextual or emotional layers  
7. Narrative manipulation that distorts reality  

Ethical violation invalidates access rights.

---

## 4. Human Dignity & Context Preservation

### 4.1 Context Is Mandatory
RWD must always be accompanied by:
- temporal context  
- environmental context  
- human limitation context  

Data stripped of context is unethical.

---

### 4.2 No Performance Judgement
RWD must not be used to:
- rank human productivity  
- compare individuals competitively  
- enforce efficiency metrics  
- shame or penalize human limitation  

DGCP rejects performance-based data ethics.

---

## 5. Consent & Awareness
Human originators must:
- be aware of how RWD may be used  
- retain ownership rights  
- retain the right to contextual explanation  

Consent does not imply surrender of dignity.

---

## 6. Ethical Review Mechanism
All questionable use cases must undergo:
1. governance review  
2. license compliance check  
3. human impact assessment  
4. public transparency record  

Ethical review favors caution over expansion.

---

## 7. Interaction with AI Systems
AI systems must:
- respect ethical boundaries  
- avoid abstraction that removes humanity  
- refrain from predictive exploitation  
- preserve uncertainty and limitation  

AI must not become an interpreter of human worth.

---

## 8. Ethical Violation Handling
If an ethical breach is detected:
- access is suspended  
- violation is documented  
- provenance remains intact  
- public notice is recorded  

No violation justifies erasing history.

---

## 9. Why Ethical Boundaries Matter
Without boundaries:
- humans become data commodities  
- truth becomes narrative  
- AI amplifies harm  
- governance collapses  

DGCP treats ethics as infrastructure, not policy.

---

## 10. Global Relevance
This ethical boundary framework applies to:
- AI governance bodies  
- research institutions  
- international auditors  
- public-interest data systems  
- post-synthetic data environments  

MaMeeFarm™ establishes ethics as a **non-negotiable layer of truth governance**.
