# DATA-REVOCATION-POLICY.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Data Revocation Policy (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines how access to Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP may be revoked
without deleting, altering, or concealing the original data.

DGCP separates **data existence** from **data access rights**.

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Data is never erased. Access may be revoked.**

Revocation applies to permissions, not to reality.

---

## 3. What Revocation Means
Revocation under DGCP:
- removes access rights
- suspends usage permissions
- blocks further interaction
- preserves full provenance

Revocation does not:
- delete data
- modify files
- rewrite history
- conceal records

---

## 4. Revocation Triggers
Access may be revoked if:
- license terms are violated
- synthetic reconstruction is attempted
- ethical boundaries are breached
- access scope is exceeded
- misuse is detected
- governance decisions require restriction

Triggers must be documented.

---

## 5. Revocation Process

### Step 1 — Trigger Identification
Violation or risk is detected via audit, governance review, or report.

### Step 2 — Evidence Review
Governance reviews:
- original data (unchanged)
- access logs
- license acknowledgements
- contextual records

### Step 3 — Revocation Decision
Human governance confirms revocation scope and duration.

### Step 4 — Public Record
Revocation is:
- timestamped
- recorded publicly
- linked to affected access credentials

---

## 6. Scope of Revocation
Revocation may apply to:
- individuals
- institutions
- AI systems
- specific access methods
- defined time periods

Revocation must be proportional and explicit.

---

## 7. AI-Specific Revocation
AI access must be revoked immediately if:
- reconstruction is attempted
- training extraction is detected
- generative imitation is proposed

AI systems do not receive warnings — only enforcement.

---

## 8. No Retroactive Control
Revocation:
- does not invalidate past lawful access
- does not rewrite audit history
- does not conceal prior usage

History remains visible.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This policy operates with:
- PERMISSION-AND-ACCESS-CONTROL.md  
- ETHICAL-BOUNDARY-FOR-RWD-USE.md  
- GOVERNANCE-DECISION-FLOW.md  
- RWD-CHANGE-PREVENTION-MECHANISM.md  

Revocation enforces governance without rewriting truth.

---

## 10. Why This Policy Matters
Most systems delete data to regain control.

DGCP preserves truth and revokes misuse.

By separating existence from access:
- history remains intact
- abuse is contained
- audits remain meaningful
- governance remains ethical  

MaMeeFarm™ treats revocation as **boundary enforcement, not censorship**.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This policy applies to:
- cross-border data governance
- AI safety systems
- public-interest transparency platforms
- research collaborations
- long-term truth archives  

DGCP establishes a global rule:  
**truth persists even when access ends**.
