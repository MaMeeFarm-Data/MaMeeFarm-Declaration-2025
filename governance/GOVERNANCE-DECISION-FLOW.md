# GOVERNANCE-DECISION-FLOW.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Governance Decision Flow (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **Governance Decision Flow** used within DGCP to make decisions related to Real-World Data (RWD) without compromising truth, provenance integrity, or human dignity.

DGCP governance decisions prioritize **process integrity over outcome optimization**.

---

## 2. Core Governance Principle
**Decisions must follow reality — not reshape it.**

DGCP does not decide what reality should be.  
It decides how reality is documented, protected, and interpreted.

---

## 3. Decision Scope
Governance decisions may relate to:
- data status classification  
- access approval or revocation  
- escalation outcomes  
- audit interpretations  
- protocol compliance  
- ethical boundary enforcement  

Decisions never alter original data.

---

## 4. Decision Flow Stages

### Stage 1 — Signal Detection
A decision process begins when:
- an anomaly is flagged  
- a request is submitted  
- an audit finding is reported  
- a policy question arises  

Signals may originate from humans or AI tools.

---

### Stage 2 — Evidence Review
Governance reviews:
- original data (unchanged)  
- timestamps and provenance  
- contextual annotations  
- related governance documents  

Evidence must be complete, visible, and unedited.

---

### Stage 3 — Standard Alignment
Each decision is evaluated against:
- DGCP Protocol v1.0  
- Zero Synthetic Data Policy  
- Human Limitation Guidelines  
- Ethical Boundary Framework  
- License constraints  

If standards conflict, truth preservation prevails.

---

### Stage 4 — Human Judgment
Final judgment is made by human governance maintainers.

AI may assist analysis but may not decide outcomes.

---

### Stage 5 — Decision Recording
All decisions must be:
- documented  
- timestamped  
- publicly visible  
- linked to relevant records  

No undocumented decisions are valid.

---

## 5. Decision Outcomes
Governance decisions may result in:
- status confirmation (*verified*)  
- status uncertainty (*uncertain*)  
- invalidation with explanation (*invalid*)  
- access modification  
- escalation to higher review  

Outcomes explain reality; they do not modify it.

---

## 6. Non-Negotiable Rules
Governance must never:
- rewrite data  
- reconstruct missing records  
- enforce artificial completeness  
- prioritize performance metrics  
- suppress ambiguity  

Governance exists to protect truth, not convenience.

---

## 7. Transparency & Accountability
Governance decisions are:
- auditable  
- reversible through new decisions  
- permanently recorded  
- open to review  

Authority comes from transparency, not secrecy.

---

## 8. Conflict Resolution
If governance members disagree:
- multiple views may be recorded  
- dissent is preserved  
- data remains unchanged  

DGCP favors plural judgment over forced consensus.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This decision flow operates with:
- DATA-ESCALATION-AND-RESOLUTION-PROTOCOL.md  
- RWD-GLOBAL-AUDIT-STANDARD.md  
- PERMISSION-AND-ACCESS-CONTROL.md  
- ETHICAL-BOUNDARY-FOR-RWD-USE.md  

Decision flow binds governance layers together.

---

## 10. Why This Flow Matters
Most governance systems optimize decisions.

DGCP safeguards reality.

By structuring decisions around truth:
- manipulation becomes visible  
- power is constrained  
- trust becomes durable  
- human dignity remains intact  

MaMeeFarm™ defines governance as **custodianship of reality**.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This decision flow applies to:
- international audits  
- AI safety governance  
- cross-border data disputes  
- public-interest oversight  
- long-term truth systems  

DGCP offers a universal model for **truth-first decision-making**.
