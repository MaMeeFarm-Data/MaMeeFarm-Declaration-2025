# ZERO-SYNTHETIC-DATA-POLICY.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Zero Synthetic Data Policy (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes the strict prohibition of synthetic, AI-generated, reconstructed, simulated, or manipulated data within the DGCP Real-World Data pipeline.  
DGCP is designed to protect human truth, not artificial imitation.

---

## 2. Core Prohibitions
The following actions are strictly forbidden:

1. **AI-generated images** replacing real proofs  
2. **AI-written logs** pretending to be human-origin  
3. **Synthetic reconstruction** of missing data  
4. **Deepfake video/audio** of human operators  
5. **Simulated environmental metadata**  
6. **Recreated timestamps**  
7. **Any digitally fabricated RWD**

Violation invalidates the full provenance chain.

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Conditions
1. If data is missing → it must remain missing.  
2. If data is imperfect → it must remain imperfect.  
3. No redoing or reconstructing past events.  
4. No artistic or aesthetic editing to “clean up” data.  
5. Only reality is allowed. Nothing else.

---

## 4. Why This Policy Exists

### 4.1 Protect Integrity  
Synthetic contamination destroys the value of RWD.

### 4.2 Protect Trust  
Global institutions must rely on data that cannot be faked.

### 4.3 Protect Human Authenticity  
RWD must reflect human limitations, not algorithmic perfection.

### 4.4 Protect Provenance  
Synthetic additions break timestamp-based trust anchoring.

---

## 5. Detection Mechanisms

### 5.1 Entropy Analysis  
Synthetic images lack natural randomness (lighting, shadow irregularities, noise variation).

### 5.2 HLWP Inconsistency  
AI cannot replicate human fatigue, pacing, or randomness.

### 5.3 Environmental Conflict  
Weather, temperature, shadows must align with real conditions.

### 5.4 Timestamp Cross-Check  
Synthetic data cannot generate matching EXIF–IPFS–Git alignment.

---

## 6. Enforcement
- Any synthetic contamination → flagged as invalid  
- Governance review required  
- Possible permanent rejection of data series  
- Public transparency log updated  

Zero tolerance.

---

## 7. Global Relevance
As synthetic data overtakes the internet, DGCP must remain a “truth lighthouse.”  
This policy ensures MaMeeFarm™ becomes a benchmark for **real human-origin data** in AI training, governance, and scientific integrity.
