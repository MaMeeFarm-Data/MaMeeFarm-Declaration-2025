# CONSISTENCY-ACROSS-MULTI-DAY-WORKFLOW.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Multi-Day Consistency Workflow Standard (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines how Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP maintains consistency across multiple days without enforcing artificial regularity or synthetic continuity.

DGCP recognizes that truth unfolds over time and must remain coherent **without being optimized**.

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Consistency does not mean uniformity.**

DGCP consistency is based on:
- believable progression
- plausible interruption
- human limitation
- environmental variability
- append-only continuity

Perfect daily symmetry is a risk signal.

---

## 3. Definition of Multi-Day Consistency
Multi-day consistency means that RWD across days:
- does not contradict itself
- respects chronological order
- reflects human fatigue and recovery
- aligns with environmental cycles
- preserves gaps as valid signals

Consistency is narrative coherence, not repetition.

---

## 4. Acceptable Multi-Day Variations
The following variations strengthen authenticity:
- fluctuating activity levels  
- missed or partial days  
- changing routines  
- evolving human understanding  
- seasonal and weather-driven shifts  

Variation confirms lived reality.

---

## 5. Prohibited Continuity Practices
The following actions are forbidden:
1. Filling missing days with summaries  
2. Reconstructing absent proofs  
3. Normalizing daily output  
4. Enforcing equal data volume per day  
5. Reordering events for appearance  
6. Smoothing long-term trends  
7. AI-generated continuity  

Any of the above invalidates provenance.

---

## 6. Workflow Rules

### 6.1 Daily Record Integrity
Each day stands as its own truth unit.

No day may be altered to support another.

---

### 6.2 Cross-Day Referencing
Days may reference:
- prior context  
- ongoing issues  
- unresolved anomalies  

References must be additive, not corrective.

---

### 6.3 Gap Handling
Gaps are:
- preserved  
- documented if context exists  
- never reconstructed  

A missing day is still part of the chain.

---

## 7. AI Interaction Boundaries
AI systems may:
- analyze trends across days  
- flag inconsistencies  
- assist in review  

AI systems may not:
- generate missing days  
- smooth multi-day patterns  
- infer undocumented continuity  

AI must respect temporal honesty.

---

## 8. Audit Interpretation
During audits:
- long-term variability supports authenticity  
- fatigue cycles validate human origin  
- gaps require explanation, not repair  
- continuity is judged holistically  

Auditors must avoid optimization bias.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This workflow aligns with:
- PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL.md  
- HUMAN-LIMITATION-GUIDELINES.md  
- ENVIRONMENTAL-ENTROPY-MODEL.md  
- RWD-ERROR-CORRECTION-BOUNDARIES.md  

Multi-day consistency reinforces the entire governance stack.

---

## 10. Why This Standard Matters
Synthetic systems excel at daily perfection.

Humans do not.

By preserving honest multi-day workflows:
- synthetic imitation becomes detectable  
- human labor remains visible  
- long-term trust is established  
- audits reflect real life  

MaMeeFarm™ defines consistency as **truth over time**, not repetition.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This standard applies to:
- longitudinal field studies  
- agricultural operations  
- climate monitoring  
- humanitarian records  
- AI safety datasets  
- public-interest data archives  

DGCP provides a universal model for **time-respecting data governance**.
