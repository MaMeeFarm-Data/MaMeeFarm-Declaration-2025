# MULTI-LAYER-TIMESTAMP-PROTOCOL.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — Multi-Layer Timestamp Verification Protocol (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This protocol defines how Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP achieves unbreakable time integrity using a **four-layer timestamp system**.  
Each timestamp acts as a trust anchor, and together they form an immutable provenance chain.

---

## 2. Timestamp Layers

### 2.1 Layer 1 — EXIF Timestamp  
- Generated by the physical device during capture  
- Includes: time, date, orientation, camera data  
- Cannot be regenerated without forensic traces  
- Represents the “moment of reality”

---

### 2.2 Layer 2 — IPFS Timestamp  
- Time of upload to distributed storage  
- Content-addressed (CID generated from file hash)  
- Proves file was unmodified between EXIF → IPFS  
- Anchors data to a decentralized timeline

---

### 2.3 Layer 3 — Git Commit Timestamp  
- Records when the file was added to DGCP repository  
- Immutable if append-only rules followed  
- Serves as human-governed verification layer  
- Commit hash reflects entire file tree state

---

### 2.4 Layer 4 — Blockchain/NFT Timestamp  
(Used optionally for proof-of-existence)

- Timestamp generated during NFT mint  
- Public, immutable, globally auditable  
- Ensures RWD existed at or before mint time  
- Adds cryptographic credibility across borders

---

## 3. Cross-Layer Consistency Requirements

A valid RWD entry must have:

1. EXIF time ≤ IPFS upload time  
2. IPFS time ≤ Git commit time  
3. Git commit time ≤ Blockchain mint time (if used)

Any reversal indicates manipulation.

---

## 4. Environmental Correlation
Timestamp validation must also confirm that:

- shadow angle  
- weather data  
- humidity / temperature  
- animal behavior patterns  
- ambient lighting  

match the declared time.

Environment and timestamp must agree.

---

## 5. Anti-Tampering Mechanisms

1. EXIF anomalies flagged automatically  
2. IPFS CID mismatch triggers integrity failure  
3. Git history must be linear and append-only  
4. Blockchain data cannot be rewritten  
5. Time gaps without explanation → flagged for audit  

---

## 6. Global Audit Process

### Step 1 — Retrieve timestamp package  
(EXIF + CID + commit + mint)

### Step 2 — Check chronology  
Must follow strict order.

### Step 3 — Validate environmental data  
No mismatch allowed.

### Step 4 — Validate provenance chain  
Check for any missing links.

### Step 5 — Confirm license compliance  
MMFARM-POL-2025 enforced.

## 7. Why Multi-Layer Timestamps Matter
This protocol ensures:

- Data authenticity  
- Chronological truth  
- Cross-border trust  
- Synthetic data detection  
- Forensic auditability  
- Regulatory compliance  
- Zero ambiguity about reality  

It enables MaMeeFarm™ to serve as a **global time-anchored truth source**.
