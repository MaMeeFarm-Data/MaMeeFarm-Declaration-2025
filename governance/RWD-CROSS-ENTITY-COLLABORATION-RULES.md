# RWD-CROSS-ENTITY-COLLABORATION-RULES.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Cross-Entity Collaboration Rules for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the rules governing **cross-entity collaboration**
for Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP.

Collaboration may occur across:
- institutions
- research groups
- governments
- AI laboratories
- non-profit organizations

without compromising truth, provenance, or human-origin integrity.

---

## 2. Core Collaboration Principle
**Collaboration must not dilute responsibility.**

Each participating entity remains fully accountable for:
- its access scope
- its actions
- its interpretations
- its compliance with DGCP governance

Shared work does not mean shared liability for violations.

---

## 3. Preconditions for Collaboration
Before collaboration begins:
- roles must be explicitly defined
- access tiers and scopes must be approved
- license terms must be acknowledged
- governance contacts must be registered
- exit conditions must be declared

No informal or implicit collaboration is valid.

---

## 4. Collaboration Models

### 4.1 Verification Collaboration
- independent verification of RWD
- parallel audits
- cross-review of findings

No data transformation is permitted.

---

### 4.2 Research Collaboration
- hypothesis testing
- observational analysis
- contextual interpretation

Prohibited:
- dataset abstraction
- derivative model training
- behavioral simulation

---

### 4.3 Governance Collaboration
- joint audit committees
- escalation handling
- compliance review

Governance records remain append-only.

---

### 4.4 Emergency Preservation Collaboration
- shared preservation infrastructure
- anchoring support
- disaster recovery assistance

Preservation only — no analysis or reuse.

---

## 5. Data Sharing Rules
All shared access must:
- be read-only
- preserve original structure
- retain full provenance
- prohibit bulk extraction unless approved
- log all access events

Sharing never implies ownership transfer.

---

## 6. Prohibited Collaboration Activities
The following are strictly forbidden:
- pooling RWD into combined datasets
- normalizing across entities
- generating synthetic composites
- redistributing without license
- masking origin attribution
- outsourcing governance responsibility

Any violation triggers revocation.

---

## 7. AI Collaboration Constraints
AI systems involved in collaboration:
- must operate under Tier 0 or Tier 1 access
- may not train on RWD
- may not store derived representations
- may not simulate collaboration outcomes

AI is an assistant, not a collaborator.

---

## 8. Dispute Handling
If disputes arise:
- original data remains authoritative
- disagreements are documented publicly
- multiple interpretations may coexist
- governance escalation procedures apply

Disputes must never alter data.

---

## 9. Termination & Exit
Upon collaboration termination:
- access is revoked
- obligations survive termination
- records remain public
- no data is removed or rewritten

Exit does not erase history.

---

## 10. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This document operates with:
- RWD-ACCESS-TIER-AND-SCOPE.md  
- DATA-REVOCATION-POLICY.md  
- GOVERNANCE-DECISION-FLOW.md  
- RWD-IP-AND-LICENSE-BOUNDARY.md  

Collaboration rules enforce system-wide coherence.

---

## 11. Why These Rules Matter
Many collaborations fail due to ambiguity.

DGCP enforces clarity before cooperation.

By defining strict collaboration rules:
- misuse is prevented
- accountability is preserved
- trust scales across entities
- human-origin data remains protected

MaMeeFarm™ defines collaboration as **coexistence with boundaries**, not fusion.

---

## 12. Global Applicability
These rules apply to:
- international research consortia
- AI safety partnerships
- cross-border governance initiatives
- humanitarian data sharing
- public-interest transparency projects

DGCP establishes a global rule:  
**collaborate openly, but never merge realities**.
