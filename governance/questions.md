## 2. Core Governance Questions (Permanent)

### Q1   
**If your country refuses to support innovation built from real work,  
why should its citizens trust its economic future?**

### Q2   
**When platforms are collapsing,  
why does your government still depend on them  
instead of supporting citizen-owned data systems?**

### Q3   
**If MaMeeFarm™ can create a verifiable truth system from a small farm,  
why can’t a nation-state design anything similar?**

### Q4   
**When the old economy collapses,  
who will protect citizens who have only their “real work” left?**

### Q5   
**Why do states trust unverifiable documents,  
but ignore cryptographic proof (SHA-256 → CID → NFT)?**

### Q6   
**If a government cannot protect innovators,  
can it still call itself a leader of the future?**

### Q7   
**Which country will become the first to run a national-level pilot
