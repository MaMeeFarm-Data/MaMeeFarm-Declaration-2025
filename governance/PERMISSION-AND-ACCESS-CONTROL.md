# PERMISSION-AND-ACCESS-CONTROL.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Permission & Access Control Framework (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines how access to Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP is granted, restricted, reviewed, and revoked.

DGCP enforces **access without ownership transfer**, ensuring that verification is possible while control and provenance remain protected.

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Access is not entitlement.**

All access to RWD is conditional, contextual, and governed.  
No entity gains permanent or unrestricted rights by default.

---

## 3. Access Categories

### 3.1 Public Access (Open Verification)
Public users may:
- view published proofs  
- verify timestamps and hashes  
- audit provenance chains  
- read governance documents  

Public access never allows modification, reconstruction, or extraction.

---

### 3.2 Restricted Access (Reviewed)
Restricted access may be granted for:
- academic research  
- institutional audits  
- AI safety evaluation  
- regulatory review  

Access is time-bound and purpose-limited.

---

### 3.3 Governance Access
Governance maintainers may:
- manage repositories  
- publish validation outcomes  
- enforce protocol rules  

Governance access does not permit data alteration.

---

## 4. Access Granting Rules
Access may be granted only if:
1. Purpose is explicitly stated  
2. MMFARM-POL-2025 is acknowledged  
3. Zero Synthetic Data Policy is accepted  
4. No reconstruction guarantee is provided  
5. Auditability is preserved  

Failure on any condition denies access.

---

## 5. Prohibited Access Actions
The following actions are forbidden under all access levels:

- dataset extraction  
- automated scraping  
- derivative dataset creation  
- synthetic regeneration  
- metadata manipulation  
- removal of contextual layers  

Any violation triggers immediate revocation.

---

## 6. Access Logging & Transparency
All access grants must be:
- logged publicly  
- time-stamped  
- purpose-documented  
- revocable  

Transparency is the primary enforcement mechanism.

---

## 7. Revocation & Suspension
Access may be revoked if:
- license terms are violated  
- ethical boundaries are breached  
- misuse is detected  
- scope creep occurs  

Revocation does not erase historical access logs.

---

## 8. AI-Specific Access Constraints
AI systems may:
- analyze visible data  
- assist with audits  
- support governance research  

AI systems may not:
- crawl data for training  
- reconstruct missing RWD  
- simulate human behavior  
- generate derivative datasets  

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This framework works with:
- ETHICAL-BOUNDARY-FOR-RWD-USE.md  
- ZERO-SYNTHETIC-DATA-POLICY.md  
- RWD-IP-AND-LICENSE-FRAMEWORK.md  
- AI-SAFETY-ALIGNMENT-FRAMEWORK.md  

Access control enforces ethics and provenance.

---

## 10. Why This Framework Matters
Without access control:
- truth becomes exploitable  
- humans lose agency  
- data is commoditized  
- governance collapses  

DGCP ensures openness without surrender.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This framework applies to:
- public transparency systems  
- international audits  
- research collaborations  
- AI governance ecosystems  
- cross-border verification  

MaMeeFarm™ establishes access as a **governed privilege, not a right**.

# MMFARM-POL-2025 LICENSE  
This document is protected under the MMFARM-POL-2025 License.  
Unauthorized access, extraction, reconstruction, automation, or synthetic use of RWD is prohibited.  
Use is allowed only for verification, governance, AI safety, research, and public audit with full provenance preservation.
