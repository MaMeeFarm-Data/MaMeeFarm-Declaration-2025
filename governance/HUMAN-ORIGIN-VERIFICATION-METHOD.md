# HUMAN-ORIGIN-VERIFICATION-METHOD. 
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Human-Origin Verification Method (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the methods used by DGCP to verify that Real-World Data (RWD)
originates from **real human activity** occurring in real environments.

The goal is to reliably distinguish human-origin data from:
- synthetic generation
- staged reproduction
- automated simulation
- post-hoc reconstruction

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Human-origin data carries biological, cognitive, emotional, and environmental signals
that cannot be perfectly replicated by machines.**

DGCP verification relies on detecting these signals over time.

---

## 3. Verification Dimensions

### 3.1 Temporal Human Rhythm
Human activity exhibits:
- irregular timing
- fatigue-driven pacing
- interruptions and delays
- non-optimized schedules

Perfect regularity is a non-human signal.

---

### 3.2 Human-Level Work Pattern (HLWP)
Verification includes analysis of:
- task sequencing
- effort variability
- micro-errors
- recovery periods
- adaptation to constraints

HLWP inconsistency across days signals non-human origin.

---

### 3.3 Cognitive Signature
Human cognition produces:
- imperfect explanations
- partial notes
- context-dependent decisions
- evolving understanding

Algorithmic consistency or retroactive coherence indicates synthesis.

---

### 3.4 Emotional Context
Human-origin data may include:
- stress
- uncertainty
- frustration
- hope
- exhaustion

Emotion shapes timing and decisions and cannot be reliably simulated over long periods.

---

### 3.5 Environmental Interaction
Human-origin data reflects:
- response to heat, rain, noise
- interaction with animals and terrain
- tool limitations
- unplanned environmental events

Lack of environmental interaction suggests staging.

---

## 4. Non-Human Origin Indicators

### High-Risk Signals
- identical daily patterns over long periods
- reconstructed continuity after gaps
- perfect metadata alignment without noise
- optimized productivity curves
- absence of fatigue indicators

### Medium-Risk Signals
- sudden skill improvement without transition
- environmental consistency beyond plausibility
- delayed explanations added retroactively

Indicators trigger review, not deletion.

---

## 5. Verification Process

### Step 1 — Provenance Review
Validate timestamps, hashes, and append-only history.

### Step 2 — HLWP Consistency Check
Compare behavior across multiple days.

### Step 3 — Environmental Entropy Correlation
Verify variability consistent with real-world conditions.

### Step 4 — Contextual Integrity Assessment
Ensure explanations are additive, not reconstructive.

### Step 5 — Governance Decision
Label status as:
- verified
- uncertain
- invalid (with public explanation)

---

## 6. Role of AI in Verification
AI systems may:
- assist pattern comparison
- flag anomalies
- support large-scale review

AI systems may not:
- decide human origin conclusively
- replace governance judgment
- infer undocumented actions

Final authority remains human governance.

---

## 7. Preservation of Ambiguity
DGCP accepts that:
- not all cases can be conclusively verified
- uncertainty is preferable to false certainty
- ambiguity may persist indefinitely

Ambiguity is documented, not resolved synthetically.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This method operates with:
- HUMAN-LEVEL-WORK-PATTERN.md  
- PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL.md  
- ENVIRONMENTAL-ENTROPY-MODEL.md  
- ZERO-SYNTHETIC-DATA-POLICY.md  

Human-origin verification is multi-layered, not singular.

---

## 9. Why This Method Matters
In a synthetic-majority future:
- appearance is unreliable
- volume is meaningless
- automation obscures truth

DGCP verifies human origin through **continuity, imperfection, and context**.

---

## 10. Global Applicability
This method applies to:
- agricultural field data
- climate observations
- humanitarian documentation
- labor verification systems
- AI safety benchmarks
- public-interest truth systems

MaMeeFarm™ establishes human-origin verification as a **foundational requirement for trust**.
