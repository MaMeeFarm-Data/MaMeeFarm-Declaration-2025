# RWD-IP-AND-LICENSE-BOUNDARY.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Intellectual Property & License Boundary for Real-World Data (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **Intellectual Property (IP) and License Boundary**
governing Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP.

The objective is to protect human-origin truth while enabling verification,
audit, and responsible use — without permitting extraction, replication,
or synthetic derivation.

---

## 2. Core Boundary Principle
**Reality can be verified, but it cannot be owned by those who did not live it.**

DGCP separates:
- the existence of truth  
- the right to access  
- the right to use  
- the right to derive  

Only the first is universal.

---

## 3. What Is Protected IP
Protected IP under DGCP includes:
- original RWD artifacts (images, videos, notes, measurements)
- provenance chains and timestamps
- Human-Level Work Patterns (HLWP)
- contextual annotations and explanations
- governance records and decisions
- system architecture and protocols

IP protection applies to *patterns*, not just files.

---

## 4. What Is Explicitly NOT Transferred
No license grants:
- ownership of original data
- rights to replicate human behavior
- permission to train generative models
- rights to reconstruct missing periods
- rights to simulate the data origin
- rights to create derivative synthetic datasets

Verification does not imply derivation.

---

## 5. Permitted Uses (Read-Only)
Under MMFARM-POL-2025, permitted uses include:
- verification and audit
- governance review
- AI safety evaluation (non-training)
- academic research (non-derivative)
- public-interest transparency

All permitted uses must preserve provenance intact.

---

## 6. Prohibited Uses
The following actions are strictly prohibited:
1. Generative AI training on RWD
2. Pattern extraction for imitation
3. Behavioral cloning or simulation
4. Synthetic data generation from RWD
5. Commercial resale without explicit agreement
6. License sub-granting
7. Obfuscation of provenance

Any prohibited use triggers revocation.

---

## 7. Boundary Enforcement Mechanisms
DGCP enforces IP boundaries via:
- embedded license in every file
- public governance records
- access control and revocation
- cryptographic anchoring
- append-only audit trails

Enforcement is structural, not discretionary.

---

## 8. Derivative Boundary Clarification
The following are considered **derivative works**:
- abstracted datasets removing context
- normalized or cleaned versions
- AI-generated summaries used for training
- reconstructed timelines
- simulated replicas of HLWP

Derivative creation without permission is forbidden.

---

## 9. Jurisdictional Handling
Across jurisdictions:
- original DGCP license remains authoritative
- local laws may add constraints
- no jurisdiction may weaken DGCP boundaries
- conflicts are documented publicly

Law does not overwrite lived reality.

---

## 10. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This boundary operates with:
- DATA-REFERENCE-POLICY.md  
- PERMISSION-AND-ACCESS-CONTROL.md  
- DATA-REVOCATION-POLICY.md  
- RWD-GLOBAL-INTEROPERABILITY-STANDARD.md  

IP boundaries ensure safe global interaction.

---

## 11. Why This Boundary Matters
Most systems extract value by abstraction.

DGCP protects value by **preserving human origin**.

By enforcing strict IP boundaries:
- exploitation is prevented
- trust remains durable
- AI misuse is constrained
- human labor is respected

MaMeeFarm™ defines IP not as ownership of files,
but as **custodianship of lived reality**.

---

## 12. Global Applicability
This boundary applies to:
- international research collaborations
- AI companies and labs
- governments and regulators
- supply-chain transparency systems
- long-term truth infrastructures

DGCP establishes a global rule:
**verify freely, derive never**.
