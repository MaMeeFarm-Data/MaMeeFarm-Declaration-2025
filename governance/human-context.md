# DGCP™ Governance — Human Context Specification  
Version: 1.0.0  
Status: Draft  
License: MMFARM-POL-2025

## 1. Overview  
Human Context is the most important dimension of DGCP™.  
Every piece of Real-Work Data at MaMeeFarm™ originates from human life, human effort, human limitations, and human intention — not from automation or synthetic processes.

This document defines how Human Context must be captured, preserved, and verified across all DGCP layers.

## 2. Why Human Context Matters  

### 2.1 Foundation of Real-World Data  
Machines can measure temperature.  
Sensors can detect humidity.  
AI can generate unlimited images.

But only **humans** can:
- choose to take a photo  
- decide to collect the egg  
- walk 3 km for food  
- care for injured ducks  
- document truth in difficult conditions  

This transforms each Proof into **Human-Attached Data** — which cannot be replicated by AI or automation.

### 2.2 Human Context Protects Against Synthetic Data  
The world is shifting into synthetic datasets.

DGCP provides a counterforce by embedding:
- Human decision  
-, Human difficulty  
- Human physical labor  
- Human scarcity  
- Human emotional and environmental reality  

This makes DGCP uniquely valuable in the future AI economy.

## 3. Required Human-Context Fields  

Each Proof must include at least:

1. **Actor**  
   - MaMee  
   - P'Toh  
   - (Specify role: collector, observer, recorder)

2. **Physical Limitation**  
   Record real constraints:
   - no electricity  
   - no refrigerator  
   - limited phone battery  
   - walking distance to buy food  
   - cold temperature affecting work  

3. **Motivation / Intention**  
   Why the action happened:
   - checking injured ducks  
   - collecting the only egg  
   - maintaining the pen  
   - capturing proof for DGCP  

4. **Environmental Hardship**  
   - weather  
   - temperature  
   - conditions affecting the work  

5. **Outcome**  
   What was done:
   - 1 egg collected  
   - dog protecting the area  
   - pen checked  
   - sensor installed

## 4. Human Integrity Rules  

1. No staged photos.  
2. No synthetic humans.  
3. Must reflect actual life conditions.  
4. No repeated or copy content.  
5. Hardship must be recorded truthfully.  
6. Limitations must be preserved for historical context.

## 5. DGCP’s Human Context Advantage  

Unlike normal farms or scientific labs:

- MaMeeFarm™ has **resource scarcity metrics**  
- DGCP’s Human Layer makes the data **scientifically rare**  
- Human Context increases **IP valuation**  
- No AI lab or corporation can recreate this environment  
- It is impossible to replicate “MaMee + P’Toh + 3 ducks + 10 dogs + Lampang conditions”

This becomes a **monopoly of truth** under MMFARM-POL-2025.

---

## 6. Conclusion  
Human Context is the essence of DGCP’s uniqueness.  
It ensures that Real-Work Data is not just “data,” but a direct reflection of the human lives that produce it.

This specification protects MaMeeFarm’s authenticity and prevents any future system from replacing or copying DGCP’s real-world origin.
