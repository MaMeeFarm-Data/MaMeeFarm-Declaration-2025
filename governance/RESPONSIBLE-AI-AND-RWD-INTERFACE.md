# RESPONSIBLE-AI-AND-RWD-INTERFACE.md  
MaMeeFarm™ — Responsible AI and Real-World Data Interface Standard (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines how AI systems may interface with Real-World Data (RWD) generated under DGCP while preserving human authenticity, provenance integrity, ethical boundaries, and the MMFARM-POL-2025 license requirements.

The objective is to ensure **AI may learn from RWD but must never imitate, reconstruct, replace, or exploit it.**

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Human-First  
RWD is human-origin and must remain tied to real human labor, limitations, and context.

### 2.2 No Reconstruction  
AI may not generate or fill missing RWD.

### 2.3 No Simulation of Humans  
AI cannot:
- simulate MaMeeFarm’s environment  
- recreate HLWP patterns  
- impersonate the human operator  
- generate fake RWD farms  

### 2.4 Boundary Enforcement  
AI access must comply with:
- MMFARM-POL-2025  
- Data authenticity rules  
- Zero Synthetic Data Policy  
- Governance integrity mandate  

---

## 3. Allowed AI Interactions (Safe)

AI may:
- analyze RWD  
- detect patterns  
- assist with governance research  
- support timestamp consistency checks  
- provide high-level insights  
- contribute to system architecture  
- help audit provenance gaps (but not fill them)

AI may **observe** but not **imitate**.

---

## 4. Prohibited AI Interactions (Unsafe)

AI must not:
1. Reconstruct real images  
2. Generate replacement RWD  
3. Simulate environmental metadata  
4. Create synthetic continuity  
5. Regenerate missing files  
6. Predict or fabricate what “should have happened”  
7. Imitate P’Toh, MaMee, or any human participant  
8. Train adversarial models using RWD patterns  
9. Attempt to reproduce human-level randomness  

These actions violate governance integrity and invalidate provenance.

---

## 5. Ethical Boundaries

### 5.1 Respect for Human Labor  
RWD reflects real costs, risks, and physical effort.

### 5.2 Respect for Human Weakness  
Missed data = valid real-world signal  
AI may not label human limitation as “error.”

### 5.3 Zero Exploitation  
AI must not extract personal identity, hardship patterns, or socio-economic vulnerabilities.

---

## 6. AI Integration Layers

### 6.1 Observation Layer  
AI may read, analyze, and interpret.

### 6.2 Advisory Layer  
AI may generate:
- technical reports  
- governance suggestions  
- anomaly flags  
- chain integrity audits  

### 6.3 Boundary Layer  
AI must defer to human governance decisions.

### 6.4 Non-Autonomous Layer  
AI is never allowed to:
- approve  
- reject  
- alter  
- rewrite  
- clean  
- correct  
- choose  
any RWD.

---

## 7. Continuity Protection
AI must not create systems that:
- bypass timestamps  
- compress provenance  
- replace human-level randomness  
- automate real-world tasks for RWD creation  

DGCP relies on **human reality**, not automation.

---

## 8. Global Relevance
This interface standard supports:
- AI governance institutions  
- AI safety labs  
- ethics research groups  
- RWD provenance standards  
- open-data accountability  
- digital integrity bodies  

It is the first AI interface designed specifically for verified human-origin data.
