# Governance Architecture – MMFARM-POL-2025  
**Category:** Governance  
**Scope:** Global, Non-jurisdictional  
**Owner:** MaMeeFarm™

## 1. Purpose of the Governance Architecture

This document defines the **governance structure** of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol (MMFARM-POL-2025).  
It answers the core questions:

- Who owns the protocol?  
- Who can use the protocol?  
- Who can validate data?  
- What rights do participants have?  
- What boundaries exist for states, companies, and AI systems?

## 2. Governance Principles

1. **Protocol-first governance**  
   The protocol is the highest authority. No platform, government, or corporation overrides it.

2. **Data Integrity First**  
   All decisions must protect verifiable truth (SHA-256 → CID → NFT → License).

3. **People-First Philosophy**  
   Users (farmers, workers, citizens) do not need to learn cryptography.

4. **Global Interoperability**  
   The system must remain neutral and able to work across countries.

5. **Immutability of Proof**  
   Raw Work Data → cannot be deleted after proof is generated.

6. **IP Sovereignty**  
   All Real-Work Data and its structures are protected under MMFARM-POL-2025.

## 3. Roles in Governance

### 3.1 Protocol Steward  
**MaMeeFarm™ Core (P’Toh & MaMee)**  
- Defines evolution of the protocol  
- Owns IP & licensing  
- Maintains structure of Proof Units, Collections, and Architectural Files  
- Oversees the stability of Real-Work Data standards

### 3.2 Contributors  
People providing raw life data (RLD).  
They own their lived experience but **all cryptographic structures belong to the protocol**.

### 3.3 Verifiers  
Independent actors who audit:  
- Hash integrity  
- CID mapping  
- Timestamps  
- NFT metadata  
- Proof link consistency

### 3.4 External Entities  
Governments, institutions, AI systems.  
They **must comply** with MMFARM-POL-2025 before accessing or using any Proof Unit.

## 4. Governance Layers

### Layer 1 — **Data Governance**  
Rules for:  
- Capture  
- Normalization  
- Hashing  
- Timestamp rules  
- Multi-source verification  
- IPFS addressing  
- Commit protocol

### Layer 2 — **Proof Governance**  
Rules for:  
- Hash manifests  
- Merkle Root structure  
- NFT integrity  
- CID compliance  
- GitHub lineage protection

### Layer 3 — **License Governance**  
Rules for:  
- Legal rights  
- Redistribution  
- Commercial usage  
- Research usage  
- Enforcement terms

---

## 5. Authority Model

### Highest Authority:  
**The Architecture (Concept Layer)**  
↓  
**The Proof Layer**  
↓  
**The License (MMFARM-POL-2025)**  
↓  
**Implementations (GitHub, IPFS, NFTs)**  
↓  
**Platforms (Optional)**

No state, company, or AI may reverse the authority order.

---

## 6. Governance Boundaries

1. No external party may **modify Proof Units**.  
2. No one may override **hash integrity**.  
3. No entity may produce “similar” Proof-of-Work Data without licensing.  
4. The protocol cannot be coerced, bought, or overridden.  
5. Investors cannot dictate design choices.  
6. Governments must respect data sovereignty.

---

## 7. Enforcement

Integrity violations trigger:  
- Digital invalidation  
- License breach notification  
- Public governance disclosure  
- Permanent hash mismatch evidence

---

## 8. Transparency Rules

All changes to:  
- Architecture  
- License  
- Governance  
must be recorded as:  
- GitHub commits  
- Governance questions  
- Hash-protected announcements

---

## 9. Future Governance Expansion

- Multi-country pilots  
- Overlays for ESG or agriculture  
- AI-based verification layers  
- Automated grant eligibility  
- Public dashboards
