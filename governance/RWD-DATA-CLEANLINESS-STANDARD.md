# RWD-DATA-CLEANLINESS-STANDARD  
MaMeeFarm™ — Real-World Data Cleanliness Standard (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This standard defines what “clean data” means within the DGCP framework for Real-World Data (RWD).

Unlike conventional data systems that prioritize visual perfection or statistical uniformity, DGCP defines cleanliness as **truthful preservation of reality**, including noise, errors, gaps, and imperfections.

---

## 2. Definition of Data Cleanliness (DGCP)
Under DGCP, data cleanliness means:
- no alteration of reality
- no removal of contextual noise
- no synthetic correction
- no aesthetic enhancement
- no reconstruction of missing information

Clean data is **unaltered reality**, not optimized appearance.

---

## 3. Prohibited “Cleaning” Practices
The following actions are strictly prohibited:

1. Image enhancement to improve clarity  
2. Noise reduction that alters original capture  
3. Color correction to “normalize” conditions  
4. Cropping that removes contextual evidence  
5. Editing timestamps or metadata  
6. Filling missing logs with summaries  
7. Rewriting human notes for consistency  
8. Reordering files to appear continuous  

Any of the above invalidates provenance.

---

## 4. Allowed Data Hygiene Practices
The following are permitted and encouraged:

- file naming standardization  
- directory organization  
- metadata documentation (without alteration)  
- contextual annotation added as **new records**  
- explanation of anomalies in separate logs  
- validation flags without data modification  

Hygiene ≠ alteration.

---

## 5. Noise as Signal
In RWD, noise is valuable:

- blur indicates motion  
- uneven lighting indicates time of day  
- gaps indicate human limitation  
- mistakes indicate real labor  
- inconsistencies indicate environmental entropy  

Removing noise removes truth.

---

## 6. Cleanliness Across Data Types

### 6.1 Images
- original resolution only  
- original metadata preserved  
- no filters or enhancements  

### 6.2 Text Logs
- original wording preserved  
- grammar errors allowed  
- emotional expressions allowed  

### 6.3 Metadata
- raw capture values retained  
- no normalization  
- no smoothing  

### 6.4 Derived Indices
- must reference original data  
- must not overwrite source  
- must preserve uncertainty  

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Standards
This standard works in conjunction with:
- ZERO-SYNTHETIC-DATA-POLICY  
- PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL  
- MULTI-LAYER-TIMESTAMP-PROTOCOL  
- DGCP-PROTOCOL-V1-SPECIFICATION  

Cleanliness supports provenance; it does not replace it.

---

## 8. Audit Criteria
During audits, data is considered “clean” if:

- original files are intact  
- metadata is unaltered  
- noise patterns are consistent with reality  
- gaps are documented, not repaired  
- no synthetic traces exist  

---

## 9. Why This Standard Matters
Most AI failures originate from “over-cleaned” data.

By preserving reality:
- AI safety improves  
- audits become meaningful  
- manipulation becomes detectable  
- human labor remains visible  

DGCP treats cleanliness as **ethical restraint**, not technical polish.

---

## 10. Global Applicability
This standard applies to:
- agriculture and climate data  
- supply-chain verification  
- AI training validation  
- human-labor provenance systems  
- post-synthetic data governance  

MaMeeFarm™ establishes a new definition of clean data: **untouched truth**.
