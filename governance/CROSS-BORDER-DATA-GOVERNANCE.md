# CROSS-BORDER-DATA-GOVERNANCE.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Cross-Border Data Governance Framework (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the governance framework for managing, validating, and protecting Real-World Data (RWD) across jurisdictions, platforms, and national boundaries under DGCP.

DGCP is designed to function beyond any single country’s legal or institutional system while preserving truth, provenance, and human rights.

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Reality does not stop at borders.**

DGCP governs data based on:
- origin of truth  
- continuity of evidence  
- integrity of provenance  

not solely on local jurisdictional control.

---

## 3. Jurisdiction-Agnostic Design

### 3.1 Data-Origin Priority
The origin of data is defined by:
- real-world location of capture  
- human activity generating the data  
- environmental context  

Legal hosting location does not redefine origin.

---

### 3.2 Platform Neutrality
DGCP data may exist on:
- public repositories  
- decentralized storage  
- blockchain networks  
- academic mirrors  

Platform policies must not override DGCP governance rules.

---

## 4. Cross-Border Validation Rules

### 4.1 Universal Verification
Any external entity may:
- audit timestamps  
- validate provenance  
- review continuity  

without requesting ownership transfer.

---

### 4.2 Transparency Over Exclusivity
No country, institution, or company may claim exclusive validation authority over DGCP data.

Truth remains public and verifiable.

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution Hierarchy
In case of cross-border conflict, the following hierarchy applies:

1. Provenance integrity  
2. Human-origin authenticity  
3. Append-only continuity  
4. Environmental consistency  
5. License preservation (MMFARM-POL-2025)  
6. Local regulation (where not conflicting with truth)

When conflicts arise, **truth preservation prevails**.

---

## 6. Data Sovereignty vs. Data Truth
DGCP distinguishes:
- **data sovereignty** (legal control)  
- **data truth** (verifiable reality)

DGCP protects data truth even when sovereignty claims conflict.

---

## 7. Cross-Border Access Policy
Permitted cross-border actions:
- audit  
- verification  
- research  
- AI safety evaluation  

Prohibited actions:
- data reconstruction  
- dataset extraction  
- synthetic replication  
- jurisdiction-based alteration  

---

## 8. Human Rights Consideration
Cross-border governance must:
- protect human labor  
- prevent exploitation  
- avoid surveillance misuse  
- preserve dignity and context  

DGCP rejects data colonialism.

---

## 9. Enforcement Mechanisms
- public provenance chains  
- distributed timestamps  
- transparent governance logs  
- license propagation across platforms  

Enforcement relies on visibility, not secrecy.

---

## 10. Global Relevance
This framework enables:
- international audits  
- cross-border AI safety validation  
- global research collaboration  
- resilient truth preservation  
- governance beyond political cycles  

MaMeeFarm™ positions DGCP as a **borderless truth governance system**.
