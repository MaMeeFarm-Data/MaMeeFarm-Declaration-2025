# RWD-IP-AND-LICENSE-FRAMEWORK  
MaMeeFarm™ — Real-World Data IP & License Framework (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the Intellectual Property (IP) and licensing framework governing all Real-World Data (RWD) generated under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) system.

The objective is to protect:
- human-origin labor  
- data provenance integrity  
- governance independence  
- long-term public trust  

while enabling responsible global use for verification, research, and AI safety.

---

## 2. Ownership Principles

### 2.1 Human-Origin Ownership
All RWD is owned by the human creator who performed the real-world work that generated the data.

RWD ownership is not transferred by:
- publication  
- storage on public platforms  
- minting or timestamping  
- audit or validation processes  

Ownership remains with MaMeeFarm™ and the human operator (P’Toh).

---

### 2.2 Separation of Ownership and Access
Access to RWD does not imply ownership.

Entities may:
- read  
- audit  
- analyze  
- verify  

but may not:
- copy as a dataset  
- reconstruct missing data  
- simulate reality  
- create derivative synthetic works  

---

## 3. License Structure — MMFARM-POL-2025

### 3.1 License Scope
The MMFARM-POL-2025 License applies to:
- all governance documents  
- all proof files  
- all metadata  
- all derived indices  
- all validation outputs  

The license travels with the data across platforms and borders.

---

### 3.2 Permitted Uses
Under MMFARM-POL-2025, permitted uses include:
- truth verification  
- scientific research  
- AI safety evaluation  
- governance alignment  
- public audit  
- non-extractive analysis  

All uses must preserve provenance and context.

---

### 3.3 Prohibited Uses
The following are strictly prohibited:
1. Synthetic reconstruction of RWD  
2. Simulation of human behavior  
3. Training generative models to imitate RWD  
4. Dataset extraction for resale  
5. Removal of contextual metadata  
6. Derivative works that obscure provenance  
7. Use for deception, manipulation, or misrepresentation  

Violation invalidates license rights immediately.

---

## 4. AI-Specific Licensing Constraints
AI systems may:
- analyze RWD  
- assist in governance review  
- support anomaly detection  

AI systems may not:
- generate replacement data  
- imitate human-origin patterns  
- simulate missing days  
- compress provenance into synthetic summaries  

RWD is **observable**, not **reproducible**.

---

## 5. Jurisdiction & Cross-Border Protection
This license is designed to operate across jurisdictions.

Key principles:
- data integrity overrides platform policy  
- provenance overrides local modification rules  
- append-only history must be respected  
- public auditability is mandatory  

Conflicts default to preservation of truth.

---

## 6. Enforcement Mechanisms

1. Public provenance chains  
2. Multi-layer timestamps  
3. Transparency logs  
4. License notice propagation  
5. Governance review records  

Enforcement favors visibility over secrecy.

---

## 7. Termination & Survival
License rights terminate immediately upon violation.

The following survive termination:
- ownership claims  
- provenance records  
- public audit trails  
- historical integrity  

No violation erases history.

---

## 8. Why This Framework Matters
Without IP protection:
- human labor is exploited  
- data is stripped of context  
- synthetic misuse escalates  

With this framework:
- humans retain control  
- truth remains intact  
- AI development is constrained ethically  
- global trust becomes possible  

MaMeeFarm™ establishes RWD as **protected human reality**, not free synthetic fuel.

# MMFARM-POL-2025 LICENSE  
This document and all associated Real-World Data are protected under the MMFARM-POL-2025 License.  
Unauthorized reconstruction, simulation, derivative synthesis, dataset extraction, or ownership transfer is prohibited.  
Use is permitted only for verification, research, AI safety, governance alignment, and public audit, with full provenance preservation.
