# DGCP Governance: Time Authority Hierarchy

**Effective Date:** 18 December 2025  
**Status:** Active Governance Policy  
**Applies to:** All MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ Proof, Registry, and Audit Processes

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the formal **time authority hierarchy** governing all MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ operations.

Within DGCP™, time is treated as a governed resource, not a convenience signal.

---

## 2. Core Principle

DGCP™ governance recognizes that:

> Not all timestamps are equal.

Only cryptographically verifiable time is considered authoritative.

---

## 3. Time Authority Hierarchy (Ranked)

### Tier 1 — Cryptographic Time Authority
- OpenTimestamps (OTS)
- Anchored to Bitcoin time

This tier provides:
- Immutable proof of existence
- Global verifiability
- Zero platform trust dependency

---

### Tier 2 — Public Ledger Time
- GitHub commit timestamps
- Append-only audit history

This tier provides:
- Process transparency
- Human and system accountability
- Verifiable sequencing of actions

---

### Tier 3 — On-chain Metadata Time
- Blockchain metadata timestamps (e.g., Polygon via OpenSea)

This tier provides:
- Public witness
- Ownership and reference timing
- On-chain continuity

---

### Tier 4 — Narrative Time (Non-Authoritative)
- Social media timestamps
- Website publication times

This tier provides:
- Human context only
- No legal, cryptographic, or governance authority

---

## 4. Governance Rules

- Higher-tier time always supersedes lower-tier time
- Narrative time can never override cryptographic time
- Conflicts are resolved strictly by hierarchy order

No exception is permitted.

---

## 5. Design Rationale

This hierarchy prevents:
- Platform-driven timeline manipulation
- Narrative-based historical rewriting
- Popularity bias over factual sequence
- Emotional distortion of proof chronology

Truth must flow outward from cryptography, not inward from virality.

---

## 6. Enforcement

Any proof or claim relying exclusively on Tier 4 time is:

- Non-authoritative
- Non-verifiable
- Excluded from DGCP™ official records
