# DGCP as a Human-First Audit System  
**MaMeeFarm™ Declaration — 2025**

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the role of DGCP  
(**Data Governance & Continuous Proof**) as a *human-first audit system*.

DGCP exists to protect real workers from:

- Fake work and fake data  
- Invisible labor in AI systems  
- Manipulation of Real-Work records  

It is not a marketing concept.  
It is a governance layer designed to defend truth.

## 2. Core Principle

> If the work is real, the proof must be real —  
> captured at the moment it happens,  
> owned by the person who performed it,  
> and protected from alteration.

From this principle, DGCP enforces:

1. **Worker-owned Real-Work Data**  
2. **No upstream ownership** by platforms, companies, or AI models  
3. **Permanent verifiability** across time, tools, and institutions  

---

## 3. DGCP as Anti-Fake-Work Architecture

DGCP is explicitly designed to resist fake or staged records.

It requires that every Real-Work Proof includes:

- **Timestamp integrity** — no backdating, no silent edits  
- **Location anchoring** — real GPS / context metadata  
- **Hash verification** — SHA-256 over all proof artifacts  
- **Append-Only governance** — data is added, never replaced  

Any record that cannot meet these conditions  
*must not* be labelled as DGCP-compliant Real-Work Data.

## 4. Human-First, Not Tech-First

DGCP does not start from blockchain, cloud, or AI.  
It starts from the human doing the work.

Technology is required to:

- Protect the worker’s Real-Work Data  
- Prove authenticity across time  
- Make the data auditable by third parties  

Technology is **not** allowed to:

- Claim ownership of Real-Work Data  
- Override worker consent  
- Obscure how proofs were created  

---

## 5. Rights of the Worker Under DGCP

Under this declaration, a Real-Work contributor has the right to:

1. Be recognized as the origin of the data they produce  
2. Have their proofs stored in an Append-Only, verifiable manner  
3. Audit how their Real-Work Data is used in AI, research, or policy  
4. Refuse any usage outside the declared license terms  

---

## 6. Long-Term Direction

DGCP is intended to be compatible with:

- Labor regulations  
- AI governance frameworks  
- International human-rights standards  

The long-term goal is simple:

> No worker should lose visibility  
> just because the world moved into an AI-driven data economy.
