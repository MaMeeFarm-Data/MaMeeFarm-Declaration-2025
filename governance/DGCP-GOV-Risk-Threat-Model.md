# DGCP Governance: Risk & Threat Model

**Effective Date:** 23 December 2025  
**Status:** Active Governance Policy  
**Applies to:** All DGCP™ Systems, Data, and Governance Layers

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines a formal risk and threat model governing the DGCP™ ecosystem.

It identifies systemic, technical, legal, and adversarial risks and establishes baseline mitigation principles.

---

## 2. Threat Categories

DGCP™ recognizes the following threat classes:

- Platform Dependency Risk
- Data Misappropriation Risk
- AI Exploitation Risk
- Governance Capture Risk
- Narrative Manipulation Risk
- Jurisdictional Conflict Risk

---

## 3. Core Risk Principle

No single platform, jurisdiction, or actor may become a point of failure.

DGCP™ is designed for survivability under partial compromise.

---

## 4. Mitigation Strategy

Mitigation relies on:
- Cryptographic verification
- Append-only public ledgers
- Non-destructive governance enforcement
- Explicit licensing and revocation paths

---

## 5. Governance Review

Threat models are reviewed periodically and updated through public governance commits.
