## 1. Overview
On 17 November 2025, MaMeeFarm™ achieved a major governance milestone by formalizing  
a unified Real-Work Data Protocol. The system now combines daily real-world evidence  
with a structured, verifiable, and append-only workflow designed entirely by **P’Toh**,  
the Protocol Architect and primary decision authority of MaMeeFarm™.

Today’s work moves the project from a “data collection experiment” into a  
**governance-driven protocol layer**, suitable for scaling, licensing, and  
long-term verification across farms, organizations, and future smart contract systems.

## 2. Core Governance Actions Completed

### 2.1 Standard Proof Schema Established
A 10-field global standard for Real-Work Data was finalized:
1. Proof ID  
2. IPFS Link  
3. CID  
4. Filename  
5. Date  
6. Time  
7. Temperature  
8. Weather  
9. Light Condition  
10. Notes (English)

This schema becomes the foundation for all future datasets and ensures  
interoperability across farms, research centers, and AI systems.

---

### 2.2 Official Daily Proof Input Form Launched
- Language: English only  
- Platform: Google Forms  
- Role: Capture real-world labour consistently  
- Output: Auto-synced into a **Proof Registry (Master Sheet)**  

The form is now the official method for recording all verifiable daily events at MaMeeFarm™.

---

### 2.3 Automated Registry Pipeline Activated
A fully traceable workflow is now in place:

**Real Event → IPFS (Pinata) → Daily Proof Form → Registry Sheet → GitHub Evidence**

This ensures:
- No silent deletion  
- Cross-verification between systems  
- Full transparency and long-term auditability  

---

### 2.4 Four Proof Units Registered Under Protocol
The first set of Proof Units (001–004) were formalized today with:
- `.md` files (narrative evidence)  
- `.json` CID registry files (machine-readable)  
- IPFS PIN + gateway  
- Matching timestamps and structured fields  

These serve as the baseline dataset for future analysis and protocol expansion.

## 3. Governance Authority & Roles

### 3.1 Primary Authority: **P’Toh**
All conceptual design, rule-setting, workflow decisions, licensing structures,  
and architectural directions originate from P’Toh.  
This includes:

- Proof schema  
- Verification rules  
- Data categories  
- Naming conventions  
- Protocol and license terms  
- Long-term scaling design  
- Multi-system integration  

P’Toh is the sole creator and decision owner of MMFARM-POL-2025.

---

### 3.2 Role of Real-Work Data  
MaMeeFarm™ operates on **real, irreplaceable, verifiable daily labour**.  
This is the foundation of the Proof-of-Life / Proof-of-Work system.

Data validity = originates directly from the farm’s daily operation.

---

### 3.3 Role of AI Tools (Strictly Controlled)
AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek act only as:
- Structuring assistants  
- Format converters  
- Consistency checkers  
- Analytical interpreters  

AI cannot:
- Invent data  
- Alter protocol decisions  
- Claim ownership  
- Override human governance  
- Create events  

All authority and design originates from P’Toh.  
AI operates *only* on top of verified, real-world MaMeeFarm™ data.

---

## 4. Governance Impact & Scalability

### 4.1 Transition to Protocol Stage  
Today marks the transition from “content creation →  
สู่ “protocol-level governance system ระดับประเทศ–โลก.

### 4.2 Foundation for Smart Contract Integration  
Because each proof now contains:
- Timestamp  
- CID  
- Environmental context  
- Narrative + structured data  

It can be directly consumed by smart contracts in the future.

### 4.3 Multi-Farm Expansion  
The 10-field schema and pipeline can be replicated instantly by:
- Any farm  
- Any region  
- Any country  

This gives MaMeeFarm™ the potential to become an international standard  
for Real-Work Data and agricultural traceability.

---

## 5. Summary  
Today, MaMeeFarm™ established a governance model that is:
- Human-led  
- AI-assisted  
- Evidence-driven  
- Impossible to erase  
- Ready for scaling and licensing  

This work solidifies the protocol’s credibility and positions the project  
as a pioneer in data integrity, real-world traceability, and decentralized  
labour-based asset generation.
