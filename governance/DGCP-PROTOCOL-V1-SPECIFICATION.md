# DGCP-PROTOCOL-V1-SPECIFICATION  
MaMeeFarm™ — Data Governance & Continuous Proof Protocol (Version 1.0, 2025)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines **DGCP Protocol v1.0**, the foundational specification governing how Real-World Data (RWD) is generated, recorded, verified, protected, and governed under the MaMeeFarm™ ecosystem.

DGCP is designed to establish a **globally auditable, human-first, anti-synthetic data protocol** for real-world truth.

---

## 2. Protocol Scope
DGCP Protocol v1.0 applies to:
- all Real-World Data (RWD)
- all Proof records
- all governance documents
- all metadata and indices
- all timestamped artifacts
- all validation outputs

The protocol governs the full lifecycle of data, from creation to long-term archival.

---

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Human-Origin First
All valid data must originate from real human activity in a real environment.

Automation may assist analysis but may not generate reality.

---

### 3.2 Continuous Proof
Reality is not proven once — it is proven continuously.

DGCP requires:
- daily or event-based proof
- continuity across time
- acceptance of gaps as real signals

---

### 3.3 Append-Only Integrity
Data may not be:
- edited
- rewritten
- deleted
- reconstructed

Corrections occur only through **new records**, never alteration.

---

### 3.4 Multi-Layer Verification
Every proof must be verifiable across:
- device metadata (EXIF)
- distributed storage (IPFS)
- governance records (Git)
- optional public blockchain anchoring

---

### 3.5 Zero Synthetic Reality
No AI-generated, simulated, reconstructed, or fabricated data is permitted inside DGCP.

Reality must remain imperfect.

---

## 4. Data Lifecycle Under DGCP

### Stage 1 — Capture
- Human performs real-world activity
- Data is captured using available tools
- Environmental context is preserved

---

### Stage 2 — Preservation
- Original files retained
- No aesthetic or corrective manipulation
- Metadata preserved in raw form

---

### Stage 3 — Anchoring
- Data uploaded to IPFS
- CID generated
- Timestamp anchored

---

### Stage 4 — Governance Commit
- Proof recorded in governance repository
- Append-only commit enforced
- License attached

---

### Stage 5 — Validation
- Timestamp consistency checked
- Provenance consistency evaluated
- Environmental and HLWP signals reviewed

---

### Stage 6 — Public Audit (Optional)
- Data made publicly auditable
- No ownership transfer
- No reconstruction allowed

---

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

### 5.1 Human Operator
- Generates RWD
- Provides contextual truth
- Accepts limitations as valid data

---

### 5.2 Governance Maintainer
- Enforces protocol rules
- Preserves append-only structure
- Publishes validation outcomes

---

### 5.3 External Validator
- Audits without modifying data
- Verifies provenance and timestamps
- Respects MMFARM-POL-2025

---

### 5.4 AI Systems
- May analyze
- May flag anomalies
- May assist governance research

AI may not generate, replace, or simulate reality.

---

## 6. Protocol Violations

A DGCP violation includes:
- synthetic data insertion
- provenance reconstruction
- timestamp manipulation
- governance override
- license breach

Violations invalidate affected data while preserving historical records.

---

## 7. Versioning Policy
- DGCP Protocol versions are immutable
- Updates require new version releases
- v1.0 remains permanently auditable
- Backward compatibility is documented

---

## 8. Why DGCP Protocol Exists
Existing data systems optimize for:
- volume
- speed
- cleanliness
- automation

DGCP optimizes for:
- truth
- continuity
- human reality
- auditability
- ethical AI alignment

DGCP exists because **truth must be governed, not assumed**.

---

## 9. Global Relevance
DGCP Protocol v1.0 supports:
- AI safety research
- supply-chain verification
- climate and agriculture audits
- anti-fraud systems
- public-interest data governance
- post-synthetic data era infrastructure

MaMeeFarm™ introduces DGCP as a **truth protocol**, not a platform.

This protocol specification is protected under the MMFARM-POL-2025 License.  
No modification, reconstruction, simulation, or derivative protocol implementation is permitted without explicit governance approval.  
Use is restricted to verification, research, AI safety, governance alignment, and public audit with full provenance preservation.
