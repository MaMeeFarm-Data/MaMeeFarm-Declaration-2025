# DGCP Governance: Non-Reliance on Social Media Platforms

**Effective Date:** 18 December 2025  
**Status:** Active Governance Policy  
**Applies to:** All MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ Operations

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes MaMeeFarm™’s formal governance position regarding the use of social media platforms within the DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.

Its purpose is to explicitly separate **public narrative channels** from **authoritative data, proof, and verification layers**.

---

## 2. Core Governance Principle

MaMeeFarm™ governance declares the following principle as binding:

> Social media platforms are never authoritative sources of data, proof, or time.

They are excluded from:
- Evidence generation
- Data integrity verification
- Timestamp authority
- Legal provenance
- Governance enforcement

---

## 3. Permitted Scope of Social Media Usage

Social media platforms (including but not limited to TikTok) may be used **only** for:

- Proof-of-life signaling
- Public awareness and visibility
- Human context illustration
- Directional attribution toward authoritative systems

Social media platforms must **not** be used for:

- Primary data storage
- Proof registration
- Metadata hosting
- Dataset exposure
- AI training or data extraction
- Commercial data reuse

---

## 4. Authoritative Systems (Exclusive)

Only the following systems are recognized as authoritative under DGCP™ governance:

- IPFS (Pinata / ipfs.io) — content-addressed evidence
- GitHub — append-only public audit ledger
- SHA-256 hashing — data integrity verification
- OpenSea metadata — on-chain public reference (when applicable)
- OpenTimestamps (OTS) — cryptographic time authority

In any conflict scenario, authoritative systems prevail without exception.

---

## 5. Risk Elimination & Legal Position

This governance rule structurally eliminates dependency risks associated with third-party platforms, including:

- Platform policy changes
- Account suspension or content removal
- Algorithmic suppression
- Commercial exploitation by hosting platforms

No social media platform may claim custody, ownership, or authority over MaMeeFarm™ proofs.

---

## 6. Enforcement

Any content or claim relying solely on social media platforms is classified as:

- Non-authoritative
- Non-verifiable
- Excluded from official MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ records

Violations constitute non-compliance with governance policy.
