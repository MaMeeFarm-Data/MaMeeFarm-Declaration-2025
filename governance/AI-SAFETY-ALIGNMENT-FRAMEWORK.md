# AI-SAFETY-ALIGNMENT-FRAMEWORK.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP AI Safety Alignment Framework (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This framework defines how Real-World Data (RWD) governed by DGCP aligns with global AI safety principles while protecting human-origin truth, provenance integrity, and ethical boundaries.

DGCP positions RWD as a **safety anchor** for AI systems in a world increasingly dominated by synthetic data.

---

## 2. Core Alignment Philosophy
AI safety under DGCP is based on one principle:

**AI must align to reality — not rewrite it.**

RWD exists to ground AI in verifiable truth, not to optimize, simulate, or replace human life.

---

## 3. Alignment Objectives

1. Prevent synthetic contamination of real-world datasets  
2. Ensure AI systems respect human labor and limitation  
3. Provide verifiable ground truth for AI evaluation  
4. Reduce hallucination and model drift  
5. Preserve long-term auditability of AI decisions  

---

## 4. Human-First Alignment

### 4.1 Human-Origin Priority
AI systems must treat RWD as:
- evidence of human life  
- proof of real labor  
- context-rich reality  

Human data is not “raw material” but protected reality.

---

### 4.2 Respect for Human Limitation
AI must:
- accept missing data as valid  
- avoid normalization of behavior  
- avoid productivity assumptions  
- avoid penalizing irregularity  

Human imperfection is an alignment signal, not a defect.

---

## 5. Prohibited AI Behaviors
To maintain safety alignment, AI must not:

1. Generate synthetic substitutes for RWD  
2. Simulate human behavior or environments  
3. Reconstruct missing proofs  
4. Predict or infer undocumented events  
5. Compress provenance into abstract representations  
6. Use RWD to train generative imitation models  

Any of the above violates DGCP safety alignment.

---

## 6. Allowed AI Safety Roles
AI may be used to:
- audit provenance consistency  
- detect anomaly patterns  
- assist in governance review  
- support risk assessment  
- help interpret large RWD volumes  

AI may **observe and advise**, never decide reality.

---

## 7. Alignment Checkpoints
Before AI interacts with RWD, the following checkpoints must be satisfied:

1. Zero Synthetic Data Policy compliance  
2. License acknowledgment (MMFARM-POL-2025)  
3. Human limitation guidelines acceptance  
4. Non-reconstruction guarantee  
5. Auditability preservation  

Failure at any checkpoint blocks access.

---

## 8. Misalignment Detection
Signs of AI misalignment include:
- attempts to “fill gaps”  
- smoothing irregular patterns  
- proposing reconstructed timelines  
- labeling human behavior as noise  
- recommending synthetic corrections  

Misalignment triggers immediate governance review.

---

## 9. Relationship to Global AI Safety Standards
This framework aligns with:
- AI safety research principles  
- human-centered AI ethics  
- auditability requirements  
- post-synthetic data governance  

DGCP contributes a missing layer: **verified human reality**.

---

## 10. Why This Framework Matters
AI systems trained on synthetic-majority data drift away from reality.

DGCP anchors AI to:
- lived experience  
- physical constraints  
- environmental entropy  
- human limitation  

This alignment reduces hallucination risk and increases trust.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This framework is applicable to:
- AI safety labs  
- governance institutions  
- regulatory sandboxes  
- research organizations  
- public-interest AI systems  

MaMeeFarm™ positions DGCP as a **human-aligned safety substrate for AI**.
