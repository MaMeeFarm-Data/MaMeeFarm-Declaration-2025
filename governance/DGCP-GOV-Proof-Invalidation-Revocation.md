# DGCP Governance: Proof Invalidation & Revocation

**Effective Date:** 20 December 2025  
**Status:** Active Governance Policy  
**Applies to:** All DGCP™ Proof Objects, Registries, and References

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines how DGCP™ proofs may be invalidated or revoked while preserving historical integrity and auditability.

The objective is to prevent misuse or misrepresentation without erasing factual history.

---

## 2. Invalidation Conditions

A proof may be marked as invalid if one or more of the following conditions are met:

- Evidence provenance is compromised or unverifiable
- Metadata is corrupted or altered after publication
- Licensing or governance terms are violated
- Proof is externally misrepresented beyond its original context
- Proof is used as an authoritative reference outside DGCP™ scope

---

## 3. Revocation Methodology

DGCP™ does not delete historical proofs.

Instead:
- Proofs are flagged with an invalidation or revocation status
- Registry entries are updated to reflect status change
- Original timestamps, hashes, and records remain intact

This ensures transparency while preventing continued reliance.

---

## 4. Governance Integrity Principle

Revocation protects system trust without enabling historical rewriting.

DGCP™ prioritizes:
- Audit continuity
- Evidence traceability
- Non-destructive governance enforcement

---

## 5. Enforcement

Invalidated proofs are excluded from:
- Official DGCP™ references
- Authoritative datasets
- Governance-backed claims
