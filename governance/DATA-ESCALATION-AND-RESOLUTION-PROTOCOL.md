# DATA-ESCALATION-AND-RESOLUTION-PROTOCOL.  
MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Data Escalation & Resolution Protocol (2025)

## 1. Purpose
This protocol defines how issues, disputes, anomalies, and conflicts related to Real-World Data (RWD) under DGCP are escalated, reviewed, and resolved.

The objective is to resolve issues **without altering reality**, preserving provenance, transparency, and human dignity at all times.

---

## 2. Guiding Principle
**Reality is never corrected — only contextualized.**

DGCP does not “fix” data.  
It explains, documents, and resolves uncertainty through governance.

---

## 3. Escalation Triggers
An escalation may be initiated when:

- provenance inconsistency is detected  
- timestamp anomalies are flagged  
- ethical boundary concerns arise  
- access or license violations occur  
- synthetic contamination is suspected  
- environmental or human anomalies require explanation  

Escalation is a governance action, not a data modification.

---

## 4. Escalation Levels

### Level 1 — Annotation
- Add contextual explanation  
- Preserve original data unchanged  
- Document uncertainty or limitation  

Used for minor anomalies or human-context gaps.

---

### Level 2 — Governance Review
- Conduct structured review  
- Validate timestamps and provenance  
- Assess compliance with DGCP rules  
- Publish review outcome  

Used for moderate inconsistencies or policy questions.

---

### Level 3 — Public Disclosure
- Publish findings transparently  
- Flag affected data as *uncertain* or *invalid*  
- Preserve all historical records  

Used for high-risk issues or synthetic suspicion.

---

### Level 4 — License Enforcement
- Revoke access rights  
- Enforce MMFARM-POL-2025 consequences  
- Record violation publicly  

Used for confirmed misuse or ethical breaches.

---

## 5. Resolution Rules

1. Original data is never deleted  
2. Original data is never rewritten  
3. Resolution occurs through new records only  
4. Status labels must be explicit and visible  
5. Context must be preserved alongside findings  

Resolution adds clarity, not correction.

---

## 6. Human-Centric Resolution
When human limitation is involved:
- absence is treated as valid  
- fatigue or error is contextualized  
- no punitive interpretation is allowed  

Human dignity overrides data optimization.

---

## 7. AI Involvement in Escalation
AI systems may:
- assist in anomaly detection  
- support consistency checks  
- provide risk indicators  

AI systems may not:
- decide outcomes  
- alter data  
- recommend reconstruction  
- judge human behavior  

Final authority remains human governance.

---

## 8. Transparency & Auditability
All escalation events must be:
- publicly logged  
- timestamped  
- linked to affected records  
- auditable across platforms  

Transparency is the enforcement mechanism.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other DGCP Standards
This protocol operates alongside:
- PROVENANCE-CONSISTENCY-MODEL.md  
- MULTI-LAYER-TIMESTAMP-PROTOCOL.md  
- ETHICAL-BOUNDARY-FOR-RWD-USE.md  
- PERMISSION-AND-ACCESS-CONTROL.md  

Escalation ensures governance continuity.

---

## 10. Why This Protocol Matters
Without escalation rules:
- anomalies are hidden  
- corrections become manipulation  
- trust erodes  

DGCP resolves uncertainty **without rewriting reality**.

---

## 11. Global Applicability
This protocol supports:
- international audits  
- cross-border disputes  
- AI safety governance  
- institutional review  
- public accountability  

MaMeeFarm™ establishes escalation as a **truth-preserving process**, not an error-handling routine.
