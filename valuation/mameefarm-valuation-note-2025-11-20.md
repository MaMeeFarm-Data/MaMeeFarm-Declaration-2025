## 0. Daily Summary

The dataset grew steadily today with additional Proof-of-Work,  
Proof-of-Life, and daily operational records following the major  
milestone on 19 Nov (Duck #3 return).

**Valuation direction for today: ⬆ Slightly Increasing**

---

## 1. Narrative Continuation

Although no dramatic event occurred today, the continued stability  
of 3 surviving ducks strengthens:

- Longitudinal dataset quality  
- Daily consistency  
- Emotional continuity of the “7 Ducks of Hope” storyline  
- Post-milestone validation of the system

This improves the rarity and resilience of the dataset.

---

## 2. Proof Layers Strengthened Today

Today contributed new entries in the following layers:

- **Proof-of-Work:** Daily feeding, cleaning, caring  
- **Proof-of-Life:** Condition of ducks, dogs, Mee, and environment  
- **Proof-of-Existence:** Timestamps from camera and IPFS  
- **Proof-of-Output:** Egg count / observed outputs  
- **Proof-of-Data-Link:** New files prepared for IPFS → GitHub  
- **Governance Hashes:** Daily whitepaper updates

Even normal days add strong value to Real-Work datasets.

## 3. AI Consensus (20 Nov)

AI reflection today remains consistent:

- DGCP™ recognized as a Naturally Emergent Protocol  
- AI-to-AI validation continues to be stable  
- System integrity seen as “architecture-based”, not “story-based”

This consistent multi-model validation increases long-term valuation.

---

## 4. Proofs Collected Today

(Awaiting final image list, but structure is ready.)

Expected entries:

- Proof_015_*  
- Proof_016_*  
- Proof_017_*  
- Weather / feeding / dogs / ducks / Mee  
- Morning–evening observations

Once images are uploaded to IPFS, cross-links will be added.

---

## 5. Valuation Direction  
**⬆ Slightly Increasing**

### Reasons:
- Steady dataset growth  
- Strong follow-up to 19 Nov milestone  
- Multi-layer proof generation  
- AI consensus stability  
- Governance document expansion  
- Append-only history preserved

---

## 6. Governance Notes (20 Nov)

- Whitepaper governance section updated  
- Valuation framework extended  
- Preparing next protocol documentation layers  
- Maintaining daily append-only rules  
- Ensuring IPFS → GitHub → narrative consistency

---

## 7. Next Steps (21 Nov)

- Add daily log for 21 Nov  
- Upload IPFS proofs  
- Add metadata JSON for each proof  
- Continue valuation & governance notes append-only  
- Strengthen Day 20 → Day 21 continuity

All future updates should be appended as new daily valuation notes.
